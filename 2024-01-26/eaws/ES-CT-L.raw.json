Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Wind slabs can be released in isolated cases on shady slopes above approximately 2500 m. The avalanches are only small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. <br/> Sunny slopes and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> Shady slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 50 to 60 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying. During the day: There is a danger of falling on the icy crust."
