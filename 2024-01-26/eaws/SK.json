        "comment": "In the Western, High and Western part of the Low Tatras there is an increased avalanche danger above the forest boundary, i.e. the 3rd degree. The main avalanche problem remains wind-blown snow. Strong north-westerly winds will reach speeds of 45-50 m/s (160-180 km/h) on Saturday. It will produce hard wind-beaten slabs in which stresses will propagate well. There is also a critical layer of crusts in the snow profile from Thursday's snowfall. Particularly dangerous are leeward sides of ridges, areas under glass walls and narrow couloirs. Particularly dangerous are the exposures of the S, SE, SW and E orientations. Avalanches can be released with only a small additional load, especially on steep slopes. In some cases, medium avalanches, exceptionally also large spontaneous avalanches are possible. Mountain terrain is not recommended for inexperienced hikers/ski mountaineers.",
        "highlights": "High winds with significant precipitation will cause unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow that are deposited on hard ground."

However, this will be very unevenly distributed due to strong winds. Mountain ridges will be blown into hard ground. On the leeward slopes and in places where the wind speed is lower, the new snow will be deposited in pillows and slabs of varying hardness. In the forest belt there will be mainly loose powder snow. Despite the snowfall in recent days, the snow cover is well below average at altitudes up to 1200 m above sea level."

        "comment": "The snow cover is very unevenly distributed due to the strong northwest wind. The mountain ridges and windward sides are blown into a hard, sometimes even grassy base. Much of the new snow is blown into the forest belt. Where there has been less wind activity, there is between 5 and 15 cm of new snow, which is mainly made up of hailstones. These could form a dangerous layer in the snow profile in the coming days. At altitudes of around 900 m above sea level, it was mainly wet snow with rain.",
        "highlights": "In the eastern part of the Low Tatras and Fatras there is a moderate avalanche danger above 1000 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. The very strong north-westerly wind has created wind-beaten slabs, which are deposited on hard ground, especially on the leeward sides under glass walls and in narrow couloirs. Their loosening is possible on steep slopes with a large additional retraction. Small to medium sized slab avalanches are particularly dangerous. There is virtually no continuous snow cover below 1000 m above sea level, which is why there is a low avalanche danger. Movement in mountain terrain is not recommended for inexperienced hikers/ski mountaineers."
