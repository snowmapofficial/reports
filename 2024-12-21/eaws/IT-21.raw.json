The wind slabs can be released in some cases on steep northeast, southeast and southwest facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised at their margins in particular. They are to be avoided in particular in terrain where there is a danger of falling. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, in particular along the border with France."
