Avalanches can trigger in gullies, bowls, behind protruberances in the terrain in the near-surface layers, even by one sole skier. Also isolated naturally triggered avalanches are possible, more so if the precipitation intensifies, esp. at the foot of rock walls. Avalanches can trigger in the old snowpack and grow to medium size. Whumpf noises and naturally triggered releases are alarm signals, indicators of imminent danger. Below 1800m: naturally triggered wet-snow avalanche activity will increase with the beginning of rainfall. In starting zones which have not yet discharged, small-to-medium wet loose-snow avalanches are possible,. The runout zones should be circumvented, esp. on extremely steep slopes below 1800m in all aspects, esp in the afternoon in case of extended bright intervals.",
