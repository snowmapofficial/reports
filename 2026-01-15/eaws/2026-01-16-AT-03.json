Occasionally, small, wet loose snow slides can still occur from extremely steep, sunny-side forest and meadow slopes as well as the rocky and craggy terrain or be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts on the descent. In extremely steep shady slopes above the tree line, small slab avalanches in persistent weak layers cannot be completely ruled out. The risk of being swept away and falling generally outweighs the risk of burial, especially in the hardness or icy entrance areas to steep gullies.",
