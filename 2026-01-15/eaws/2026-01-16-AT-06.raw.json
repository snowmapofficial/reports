In particular, older snowdrift accumulations in the east and north sectors, especially behind ridgelines, terrain edges and in gullies and bowls, can usually be triggered by large additional loads as medium slab avalanches.\nOccasionally, wet loose snow slides are still possible from steep rocky and rugged terrain."

Weak layers are mainly found in the old snowpack (unstable layer of faceted crystals). In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability. On the sunny slopes, the lockout is progressing again."
