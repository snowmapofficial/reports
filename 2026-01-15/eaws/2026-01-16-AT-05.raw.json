Avalanche prone locations are located in particular in the north-west, north to south-east facing steep terrain, adjacent to the ridgeline and area distant from ridgelines, behind terrain edges as well as in gullies and bowls. They increase rapidly in size and frequency with altitude from the tree line upwards. Wind slabs often lie directly next to blown-off areas, are easily recognisable and should be avoided at all costs. Cracks and whumpfing collapsing sounds when walking on the snow cover, snowpack are a sign of danger."

Moderate southerly foehn forms fresh, initially still thin wind slab, which is likely to be susceptible to disturbance on the often still soft old snow base leeward. Further weak layers of faceted crystals and deep rime lie in the persistent weak layer below and can be activated occasionally by surface avalanches. The total snow depth is still well below average in many places. Broad ridge and ridges are often completely blown off."
