Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by small additional loads. Avalanche prone locations are mainly on steep slopes with aspects from north-west to east to south-east as well as in gullies and bowls at the transition from little to much snow. The number and extent of avalanche prone locations increase with altitude. Slab avalanches can occasionally become large.\n\nWet snow is also problematic during daytime changes. Wet avalanches can detach themselves in very steep terrain, especially when exposed to sunlight. They can reach small to medium size."

A melt-freeze crust forms on the surface overnight at mid-altitudes and on sunny slopes at high altitudes.
