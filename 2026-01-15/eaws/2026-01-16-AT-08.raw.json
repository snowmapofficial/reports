Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures forming on the survace are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. In addition, small-sized freshly generated snowdrifts in high-altitude ridgeline and pass areas require caution. Activities away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing avalanche dangers."

In addition, layers inside the latest fresh snow and drifted snow are often still prone to triggering. Settling noises and fractures on the snowpack surface confirm this trigger-sensitivity."

As a result of mild temperatures, the snow at low and intermediate altitudes is moistened and the snowpack surface is melt-freeze encrusted in early morning.
