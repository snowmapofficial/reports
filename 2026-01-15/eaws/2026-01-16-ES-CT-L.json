        "comment": "Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can still be released in some places especially on steep west, north and east facing slopes. Sometimes they are medium-sized but in some cases easily released. Distinct weak layers deep in the old snowpack can be released even by people especially in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow. In isolated cases these are large. Released avalanches and field observations show this situation. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, hard wind slabs formed in the last few days in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. They can be released, especially by large additional loads,. Caution is to be exercised at their margins in particular. <br/> <br/> In addition some small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible. The current avalanche situation calls for experience and restraint.",

Distinct weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered west, north and east facing slopes. Some snow will fall on Friday. The sometimes moderate wind will transport only a little snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
