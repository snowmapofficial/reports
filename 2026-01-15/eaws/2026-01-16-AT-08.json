Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures forming on the survace are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. In addition, small-sized freshly generated snowdrifts in high-altitude ridgeline and pass areas require caution. Activities away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing avalanche dangers.",
