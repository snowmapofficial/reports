Avalanche prone locations are located in particular in the north-west, north to south-east facing steep terrain, adjacent to the ridgeline and area distant from ridgelines, behind terrain edges as well as in gullies and bowls. They increase rapidly in size and frequency with altitude from the tree line upwards.

Cracks and whumpfing collapsing sounds when walking on the snow cover, snowpack are a sign of danger.",
