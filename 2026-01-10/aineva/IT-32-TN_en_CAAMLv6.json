The avalanche prone locations are rather rare and are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. The wind slabs can be released easily in some cases above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised at their margins in particular. <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow. In very isolated cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/>"
