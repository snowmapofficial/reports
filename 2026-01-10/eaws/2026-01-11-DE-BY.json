Slab avalanches can easily be triggered in blown-in areas, especially on steep slopes with aspects from north to east to south and in gullies and bowls with little additional load. Avalanche prone locations are numerous and can also be found in forest transition areas as well as in forest aisles and clearings. Avalanches can become large.\n\nIn addition, the new fallen snow is released from the rocky steep terrain in the form of loose snow avalanches, especially when the sun is shining. Deeper weak layers can be disturbed by the additional load and the self-triggering of larger slab avalanches is then possible.",
