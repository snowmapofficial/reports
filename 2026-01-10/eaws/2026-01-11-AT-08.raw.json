One single person can trigger slab avalanches in the drifts and old snow. If the fracture sweeps away the entire snowpack, particularly in regions where fresh snowfall has been heaviest, the release can grow to large size. Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Frequency and extent of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. Also naturally triggered avalanches and remote triggerings are possible. Activities in backcountry demand defensive conduct."

The old snowpack is unfavorably structured. In addition, layers inside the fresh snow and freshly generated drifts are also prone to triggering."
