It will alternate between places where large amounts of snow (even more than 30 cm) will be piled up and places that will be blown into older hard ground, grass and rocks. Most of the snow is expected to be blown into the forest and slash belt. Due to the very cold air, this snow will not be able to bind with the base, which is made up of older snow or wind-blown slabs. More than 20cm of new snow is expected to be added during the day."
