The somewhat older wind slabs are covered with new snow and therefore barely recognisable. <br/> The wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant. In the regions exposed to precipitation this applies in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can in some cases be triggered in the old snowpack and reach quite a large size. <br/> In the regions exposed to the foehn wind the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection and spacing between individuals are recommended.",
