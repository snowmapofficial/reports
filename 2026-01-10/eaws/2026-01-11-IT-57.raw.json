As a consequence of a strong wind from westerly directions, wind slabs formed in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in northwest to north to east facing aspects above approximately 1900 m. The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence."
