Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are large. Remotely triggered and natural avalanches are possible in isolated cases. <br/> Dry avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size on shady slopes. <br/> All aspects and in places that are protected from the wind: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent dry and moist avalanches are to be expected from the early morning, even medium-sized ones. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are also numerous on popular backcountry touring routes and in freeride terrain."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Friday above approximately 1200 m. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. 5 to 10 cm of snow will fall until the early morning in all altitude zones. The wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations show a very dangerous avalanche situation in particular above the tree line. <br/> <br/> Precarious weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Monday: Gradual decrease in danger of dry avalanches.
