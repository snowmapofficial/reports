The connection to the old snow surface is therefore poor in many places. Deeper layers of the snowpack are relatively well consolidated in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. South of a line from the Rhône to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose. In these regions, avalanches can start deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>Numerous natural avalanches, as well as various avalanches triggered by human activity, some remotely over relatively large distances, are evidence of the current widespread instability of the snowpack.

There will be moderate, occasionally strong, westerly to southwesterly winds on Monday in the Prealps and generally at high altitudes, while winds will mainly be moderate at high altitudes on Tuesday.

However, especially in those regions to the south of a line from the Rhône to the Rhine, the weak old snowpack means that this decrease will be only very slow. Given the rising temperatures and sunny conditions, moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected on very steep slopes.
