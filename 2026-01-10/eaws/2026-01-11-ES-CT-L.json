The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. 5 to 10 cm of snow will fall until the early morning in all altitude zones. The wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations show a very dangerous avalanche situation in particular above the tree line. <br/> <br/> Precarious weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."
