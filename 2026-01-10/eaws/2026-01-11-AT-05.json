        "comment": "A total of 20 to 30 cm of new fallen snow has fallen in the last few days, with another 10 to 20 cm coming overnight. At high altitudes, fresh wind slabs are lying on top of soft new fallen snow, which forms a weak layer. Below 1400 metres, rainfall on Friday has partially moistened the snow cover, where a melt-freeze crust has formed that is not capable of bearing loads. The old snowpack consists of layers of faceted crystals, deep rime and melt-freeze crusts and has little tendency to break up.\nThe overall snow depth is still well below average."

Widespread 10 cm of new fallen snow, 20 cm in the northern stau. Visibility will improve during the daytime changes on Sunday. In the morning, the mountains will be covered in clouds and it may still snow a little. From midday, the clouds will become softer and softer and the sun will shine widely in the afternoon. A brisk north-westerly wind will blow and it will be much colder again. Around -16 degrees Celsius at 2000 metres."

        "comment": "The avalanche risk is moderate above the tree line and low below. In some places, wind slab adjacent to the ridgeline can be triggered as a mostly small slab avalanche by even a small additional load. Most avalanche prone locations are in the north and east sector behind terrain edges, in gullies and bowls. The risk of falling outweighs the risk of burial away from terrain traps. Also beware of stones that are only slightly covered by snow.",
