The connection to the old surface of the snowpack is poor in many places. Deeper layers of the snowpack are relatively well consolidated in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose.
