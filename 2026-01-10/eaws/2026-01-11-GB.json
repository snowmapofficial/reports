Winds will be generally South-South-Easterly strong to gale force.\nObserved Weather Influences: Snow showers overnight and today have affected the area. Showers became much heavier than expected later in the day. Winds have been fresh, generally South-Easterly. The freezing level was around 350 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Areas of unstable windslab exist in wind sheltered locations mainly on North-East through East to South aspects above 900 metres. Fresh weakly bonded accumulations of windslab are forming on Westerly and Northerly aspects mainly above 850 metres. These accumulations mainly exist in sheltered hollows, corrie rims, ridge flanks, gullies and gully tops. Fragile cornices are also present on similar aspects and altitudes.   The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
