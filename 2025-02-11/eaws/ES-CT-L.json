        "comment": "Weak layers in the old snowpack represent the main danger. These can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep, little used shady slopes. Avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> During the day: As the moisture increases small moist avalanches are possible. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate southwesterly wind, mostly shallow wind slabs will form especially at the southern border of Aran. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection.",
