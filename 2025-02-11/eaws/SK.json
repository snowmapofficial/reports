        "comment": "In all high mountains of Slovakia there is only a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. The situation is stable, the snow cover is melted and hardened. Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in the highest altitudes of the Tatras, and even then only on isolated steep to very steep slopes of the northern exposures.  The greater terrain hazard under current conditions is the potential for falling on icy or rocky surfaces.",

        "comment": "Snow cover is well below average for the time of year. Continuous snow cover is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above about 1500 m above sea level). In the absence of any precipitation and the alternation of temperatures, the snow cover has melted and frozen. Its surface is mostly frozen firn, crust on the northern slopes, and locally wind-blown snow pillows. In the valleys, paths and roads are often covered with ice. On sunlit steep slopes the snow surface softens slightly."
