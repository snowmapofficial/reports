Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. Freshly generated snowdrift accumulations are prone to triggering in some places, require attentiveness in steep terrain.The danger of small-to-medium sized glide-snow avalanches continues to be difficult to assess. Caution urged below glide cracks."

Elsewhere a wind crust is evident which is often capable of bearing loads, on sunny slopes there is a melt-crust. Small snowdrift accumulations are evident. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten/soften on steep sunny slopes. Small-area fresh snowdrifts have been generated."

At high altitudes, small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are frequently prone to triggering.

The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is difficult to estimate. Caution urged below glide-cracks."
