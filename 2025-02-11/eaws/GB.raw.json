        "SnowDistribution": "Wind scoured and bare on some aspects, some deeper drifts elsewhere. Whiteout conditions presenting challenging navigation and serious travel conditions.  Winds 30-40 mph, burly for plateau travel.",
        "Comment": "Fragile cornices continue to develop. Cornice collapse above a North-West to West aspect at 1200 metres reported on Tuesday 11th Feb.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry day is expected with very strong to gale force winds from the East-South-East. The freezing level will be around 500 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will continue to develop as snow is redistributed onto South-West through West to North aspects above 900 metres. Areas affected will mostly be where accumulations gain depth in steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gully tops. At lower elevations a dusting of snow will be present, while elsewhere the old snowpack will be firm and stable. Fragile cornices will continue to develop. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers above 400 metres overnight, and continuing until around midday. Winds were generally from the East-South-East, strong to gale force. The freezing level was around 600 metres at midday.",

Greatest deposits are confined to steep wind sheltered areas such as coire rims and gully tops. Elsewhere the old snowpack is firm and stable, with a dusting of new snow present above 500 metres. Slopes and plateau areas exposed to the wind have become scoured. Fragile cornices have developed. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
