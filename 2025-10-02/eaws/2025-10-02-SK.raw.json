In steep troughs, especially in southern orientations, a larger amount of snow, locally around 50cm, may be wind-bound, which may not be connected with the grassy base. There is a risk of slipping or loosening a small slide with a subsequent fall into steep rocky terrain.",

Please note the icy and snow-covered hiking trails, where there is a risk of losing your bearings and wandering off into unsteep terrain."
