Slab avalanches can be triggered even by the weight of one sole person. Avalanche prone locations occur in very steep ridgeline terrain in all aspects as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. The releases will mostly be small-sized. The risks of of being swept outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",

In north-facing terrain there are soft layers underneath a melt-freeze crust in the uppermost part of the snowpack.
