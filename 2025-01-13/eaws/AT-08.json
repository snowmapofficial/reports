In ridgeline terrain, in gullies and bowls, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require caution.

In risky terrain for falls, evaluate the drifts with caution, small-sized - avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier. Glide-snow avalanches still possible.",

In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, isolated slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading.  A cautious route selection is advised. Small-to-mediium glide-snow avalanches are possible only in isolated cases. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
