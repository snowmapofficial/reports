        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow and a diminishing snowpack.  Isolated patches of thawing water ice.  Poor visibility around the summits.  Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Potential for rock and ice fall during the thaw conditions.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mostly dry throughout the forecast period with the freezing level above the summits. Winds will be storm to gale force West-South-West, easing slightly to become South-West during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated weaknesses will persist at depth in steep locations on Northerly and Southerly aspects above 1000 metres. Mountain features such as Coire rims and gully tops will be most affected. Any remaining cornices will be unstable.  Elsewhere the patchy snow cover will continue to slowly thaw and stability will be generally good. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The freezing level was above the summits throughout the forecast period with a recorded summit temperature of 4.3 degrees at midday.  Winds were storm to gale force South-Westerly, decreasing to gale through the day.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Continuing thaw conditions have greatly reduced the snow cover. Weaknesses remain at depth in isolated steep locations on Northerly and Southerly aspects above 1000 metres but in general, the remaining patchy snowpack is generally well bonded and stable.  Greatest accumulations can be found above 1000 metres on ridge flanks and coire rims.  Any remaining cornices are prone to collapse.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
