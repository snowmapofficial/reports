They are to be evaluated with care and prudence in particular in extreme terrain. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
