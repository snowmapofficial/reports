Especially the leeward sides of ridges, narrow couloirs and places under rock walls are dangerous. Here, there may be wind-beaten slabs and cushions of varying hardness, which are deposited on a hard substrate, the two layers being poorly interconnected. The danger is concentrated where the old hard snow is located. The second avalanche problem is a permanently weak layer. Shady orientations and the northern slopes of our mountain ranges are therefore particularly dangerous.",

Dangerous are mainly leeward sides of ridges, narrow chutes and places under rock walls. Here there may be wind-blown slabs and cushions of different hardness, which are deposited on a hard base, the two layers being weakly interconnected. These places in the terrain are relatively easy to spot. The second avalanche problem is a permanently weak layer. Shady orientations and the northern slopes of our mountain ranges are therefore particularly dangerous. Only small avalanches in isolated locations are at risk, which, once released, pose a risk especially in combination with terrain traps (protruding rocks, terrain depressions or rock precipices).",
