With new fallen snow and a prone-to-triggering westerly wind, prone-to-triggering snowdrift accumulations can continue to form. These can be triggered by individuals as small to medium-sized slab avalanches, especially behind broad ridges and ridgelines in northern, eastern and southern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are easily recognisable with sufficient visibility. Often, some of the snow has covered over the exposed areas, so beware of the risk of injury.",
