In the steep terrain adjacent to the ridgeline in northern, eastern and southern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls, fresh snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as small to medium slab avalanches by a small additional load. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account.",
