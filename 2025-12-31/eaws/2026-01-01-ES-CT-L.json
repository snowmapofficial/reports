        "comment": "The old wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep east, north and west facing slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. They are sometimes deep and in some cases prone to triggering. Weak layers deep in the old snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In many cases the dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more gliding avalanches are possible as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep sunny slopes above approximately 2000 m and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> Southern and eastern borders of Aran: The more recent wind slabs are small but prone to triggering.",
