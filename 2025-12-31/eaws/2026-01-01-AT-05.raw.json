With new fallen snow and stormy winds from the northwest, fresh prone-to-triggering snow packs have been forming for a few days, which can be triggered by individuals in a few places from around 2200 metres. Most avalanches remain small, but enough snow could accumulate in isolated terrain traps to bury people. Be careful behind exposed ridges and ridgelines, in gullies and bowls. In shady slopes, there are still very occasional release points in persistent weak layers that are difficult to disturb. The drift snow packs are easier to recognise than weakly covered stones."
