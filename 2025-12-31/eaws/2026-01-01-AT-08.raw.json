On south-facing slopes the ground which is bare of snow up to high altitudes got a few centimetres of fresh snowfall. At high altitudes, strong-velocity westerly winds will generate fresh snowdrift accumulations. Since there are only small amounts of transportable snow, the drifts will remain small. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. Little information from outlying terrain is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services."
