        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation throughout the period will turn to snow at most levels as the freezing level lowers to 200 metres. Gale force North-Westerly winds.",
        "SnowStability": "A covering of fresh, generally stable snow will develop on top of bare ground at most elevations. Isolated windslab deposits will develop mainly on East to South aspects above around 800 metres, gully tops and coire rims will be most affected. These deposits will overlie bare ground but could begin to gain depth, as the day progresses. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Accumulations of fresh unstable windslab will develop on North-East through South-East to Southerly aspects above 900 metres, North aspects will also be affected due to cross loading. Steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gully tops will be most affected particularly where accumulations develop over old snow. Unstable cornices will also develop throughout the day.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A bright day with hill cloud developing from late morning. Very cold overnight with -10  Celsius recorded in the glens.  There was a thin covering of snow above 700 metres. Winds were very strong, North-West to North-North-West.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining snow is very firm and well bonded. Occasional patches are present above 850 metres with  greatest amounts found above 950 metres on North to East aspects, mostly around corrie rims and in gully tops.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will be hard and icy. Fresh deposits of windslab will build up through the day. Of greatest hazard will be tops of gullies above 1100 metres with an East or South-East aspect where the fresh windslab accumulates on top the old hard icy snowpack. Elsewhere any accumulations of fresh snow will be very shallow, or on bare ground and in both cases will be stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It was a cloudy and damp day with some light precipitation which fell as freezing rain above 1100 metres, and normal rain below that level. The freezing level rose to around 1100 metres before dropping during the afternoon. The wind was from the South-West.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack remains patchy, with the greatest deposits on high North and East facing slope and coires. It was starting to soften slightly below 1100 metres. Above this level it remained hard and icy. Stability is good throughout. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

New windslab will form on steep North East to South aspects above 950m with much of it accumulating on bare ground.

        "WeatherInfluences": "Strong to gale force North-Westerly winds will bring frequent snow showers throughout the period. These showers initially falling as snow above 800 metres this evening, and then to lower elevations as the freezing level drops, around 400 metres by dawn and lower through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh snow deposits, mostly landing on bare ground, will form on all aspects and at increasingly lower levels through the period. Localised deposits of unstable windslab will also form through the day, mainly in wind sheltered locations on North-East through East to South aspects above 900 metres. Most affected areas will be around gully tops, coire rims and ridge flanks. Cornices may also begin to form.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

The largest amounts of snow remain on North to East aspects above 950 metres, particularly in sheltered gullies and hollows. A trace amount of new snow is also present above this altitude.
