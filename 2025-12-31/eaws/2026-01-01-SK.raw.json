      "comment" : "Due to snowfall and strong winds, a moderate avalanche danger, level 2, has been created in all mountain ranges above the forest zone. The avalanche danger is local, concentrated in places where the wind is blowing larger amounts of new snow. This is deposited in the form of unstable snow slabs and pillows in gullies, moguls and under rock walls. Avalanche release on such steep slopes, where old frozen snow is still under the new snow, is possible, especially when additional loads are applied. Larger spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",
      "highlights" : "Watch out for wind-drifted snow that has created unstable snow slabs and pillows."

      "comment" : "The snow cover is varied. 20 to 30 cm of new snow has fallen in the last 3-4 days. However, due to strong NW winds, it has been transported to leeward places and into the forest zone, where its height reaches even more than 50 cm. In wind-exposed places, the snow surface is blown down to old snow, possibly rocks and grass. Due to the very low temperatures, the new snow cannot bind with the old snow base and remains unstable. The old frozen snow is only found from about 1400-1700 m above sea level (depending on the orientation and the mountain range). The overall snow depth remains below average, ranging from 20 to 70 cm."
