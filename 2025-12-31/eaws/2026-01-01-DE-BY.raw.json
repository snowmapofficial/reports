In the steep terrain adjacent to the ridgeline in northern, eastern and southern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls, wind slab can be triggered in some places as a small to medium slab avalanche by a small additional load. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account."
