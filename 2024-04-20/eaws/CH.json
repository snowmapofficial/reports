A lot of snow will fall again in the north on Saturday. Avalanches may occur, especially at the transition to the wind slabs from the middle of the week. However, avalanches may also be triggered more deeply in places. Towards the south, the supply of snow that might drift is appreciably smaller. This also means that fresh wind slabs are smaller and avalanche-prone locations are less prevalent. In general, the amount of new snow will increase significantly with altitude and may significantly exceed the amounts described in the bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Wet and gliding avalanche activity is currently very low. Gliding avalanches are still possible in very isolated cases.</p>"
