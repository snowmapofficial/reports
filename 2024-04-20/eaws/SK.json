Especially SE, E and NE orientations are dangerous. On the leeward sides of ridges in narrow couloirs and under rock walls there may be locally hard wind-beaten slabs, which are deposited on hard ground. Their loosening is possible with high additional loads on steep slopes. Small and medium-sized slab avalanches are particularly dangerous in combination with terrain traps. Spontaneous avalanches are not foreseen.",

The windward sides of the mountains are hard and icy, on the leeward sides of the highest altitudes (SE, SW, SE and NE) there are slabs of wind-blown snow. Where snow has fallen without wind action there is loose powder snow. Most snow is found in northeast to east orientations. Continuous snow cover is found above 1600 m above sea level."
