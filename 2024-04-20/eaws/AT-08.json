Danger zones occur esp. in steep ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in gullies and bowls. Frequency and size of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. Activities in outlying terrain demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. Isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible. Avoid zones below glide-cracks. In case of extended bright intervals, small loose-snow avalanches are possible.",
