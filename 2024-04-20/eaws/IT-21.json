        "comment": "In the last two days mostly small wind slabs formed especially in places that are protected from the wind. As a consequence of new snow and strong wind they will increase in size in the afternoon. These can to an increasing extent be released, even by small loads in isolated cases, but they will be small in most cases, especially on extremely steep slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and wind dry avalanches are possible on Monday, even medium-sized ones.",
        "highlights": "In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard crust. Wind slabs represent the main danger. As a consequence of new snow and wind the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent towards the evening."
