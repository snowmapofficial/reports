        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs are mostly small and can only be released in isolated cases, especially adjacent to ridgelines at elevated altitudes. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Only isolated gliding avalanches are possible. This applies in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2200 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
        "highlights": "Conditions are favorable concerning avalanche hazard. There is a danger of falling on the hard crust."

The wind will be moderate in some cases over a wide area. <br/> The old snowpack is moist and its surface has a resilient melt-freeze crust. The surface of the snowpack has frozen to form a strong crust and will hardly soften at all."
