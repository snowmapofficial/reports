Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain the fresh drifts need attentiveness. Due to daytime warming, the snowpack forfeits its firmness and danger rises to Level 2, moderate. Esp on steep sun-bathed slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can be expected. In steep terrain, also wet loose-snow avalanches can be triggered. Backcountry tours should be launched early and brought to an end early in the day.",
