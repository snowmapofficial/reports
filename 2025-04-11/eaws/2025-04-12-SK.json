        "comment": "In the High, Western and Western part of the Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger - 2nd degree. A warm front will pass through the mountains during the night, bringing precipitation and still strong northerly winds. On Saturday, the avalanche danger will be created by warming caused by the influence of clear warm weather. New blown snow from the windy and cold weather of the last week is lying on top of the old snow cover with weak links between these layers. Strong radiation from the spring sun will have a significant effect on the layer of blown new snow, which will be heavily packed during Saturday. Avalanche release will be possible, especially on steep sunlit slopes, while numerous spontaneous avalanches and smaller avalanches are also expected during the day.",
