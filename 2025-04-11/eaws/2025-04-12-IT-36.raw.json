The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The mostly small wind slabs have bonded quite well with the old snowpack. The avalanches can be released by large loads. Backcountry tours should be started and concluded very early. <br/> In the event of a clear night caution is to be exercised in the late morning. In many places there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."
