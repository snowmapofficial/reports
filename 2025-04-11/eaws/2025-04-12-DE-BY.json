Glide-snow avalanches are possible in all aspects on very steep slopes over smooth ground that have not yet discharged, in sparsely wooded deciduous forests, or on smooth rock slabs. As the day progresses, medium-sized glide-snow avalanches cannot be ruled out in sunny higher altitude terrain. Where there is still enough snow, wet loose snow avalanches can release spontaneously on extremely steep E/S/W-facing slopes during the course of the day. Above 1600m releases can grow to medium size, if the thoroughly wet snowpack is entrained completely.",
