Medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading in some places, caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow. Danger zones occur esp. on very steep north-facing slopes above 2400m and on W/E-facing slopes above 2600m. Due to daytime warmth and solar radiation, avalanche danger increases to moderate during the daytime at all altitudes. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small moist loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day or be triggerered by persons descending and grow to medium size, esp. in high-altitude starting zones. Backcountry tours and ascents to refuges should be launched early and come to an end early in the day. From very steep grass-covered slopes, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally."

In high-alpine regions, thin snowdrifts are being generated on E/S-facing slopes. On shady slopes below 2200m and on sunny slopes, the old snowpack is mostly moist. On very steep, little structure terrain surfaces, the entire snowpack oftens glides downhill."
