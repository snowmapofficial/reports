Daytime hours: due to rising temperatures and solar radiation, likelihood of wet loose-snow avalanches will increase significantly esp. along the Italian border. Isolated naturally triggered avalanches are possible due to the thoroughly wet snowpack. Wet-snow avalanches can often fracture down to ground level. Wet-snow avalanches can reach medium size, esp. on extremely steep sunny slopes in high altitude starting zones. The runout zones should be avoided. Weak layers in the old snow above 2300m can trigger in isolated cases, esp. by large additional loading. These danger zones occur on steep slopes on W/N/E-facing slopes.
