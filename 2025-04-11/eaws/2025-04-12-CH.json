In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. In recent days, however, no more slab avalanches triggered by human activity have been reported there either.</p><p>On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes, the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated up to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m.</p><p>During the night into Saturday, the wet surface of the snowpack will freeze, at least at high altitudes. With the warmth and as a  consequence of solar radiation, the melt-freeze crust will soften rapidly and the danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase significantly. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, moist slab avalanches can also be triggered by human activity in some places.</p>"

In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. In recent days, however, no more slab avalanches triggered by human activity have been reported there either.</p><p>On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes, the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated up to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m.</p><p>During the night into Saturday, the wet surface of the snowpack will freeze, at least at high altitudes. With the warmth and as a  consequence of solar radiation, the melt-freeze crust will soften rapidly and the danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase significantly. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, moist slab avalanches can also be triggered by human activity in some places.</p>"
