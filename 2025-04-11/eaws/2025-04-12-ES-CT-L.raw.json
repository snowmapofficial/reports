All aspects: As the penetration by moisture increases more wet and gliding avalanches are possible at any time, even large ones in isolated cases. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally. Naturally triggered avalanches and field observations indicate this situation."

The surface of the snowpack will freeze very little and will soften quickly. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours should be started and concluded very early. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks."
