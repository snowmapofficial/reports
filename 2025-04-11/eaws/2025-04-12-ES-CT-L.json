        "comment": "As a consequence of high temperatures, partly cloudy skies and the strong southerly foehn wind, no crust will develop on the surface during the course of the night. All aspects: As the penetration by moisture increases more wet and gliding avalanches are possible at any time, even large ones in isolated cases. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally. Naturally triggered avalanches and field observations indicate this situation.",
