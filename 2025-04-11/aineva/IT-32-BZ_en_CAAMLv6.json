They can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> Early morning: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases and mostly by large additional loads, in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2800 m. Avalanches can in some cases reach medium size."

In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 3000 m. <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is moist, especially on sunny slopes, as well as in all aspects below approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used west, north and east facing slopes. This applies on shady slopes above approximately 2600 m, as well as on west and east facing slopes above approximately 2800 m. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations."
