Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain, at entries into gullies and bowls and behind discontinuities. Wherever the snow is bonded like a slab, medium-sized avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person. Frequency of danger zones increases with ascending altitude. In shady extremely steep terrain and gullies, isolated large-sized avalanches can be triggeredd (persistent weak layer).",
