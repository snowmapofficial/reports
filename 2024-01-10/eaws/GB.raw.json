        "Summary": "NC for 11.1: Isolated unstable windslab on NW to NE aspects above 900m. Elsewhere a crust overlies a stable snowpack. Low Hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Icy paths and hillsides, the snowpack is covered by a widespread crust of varying strength.  Bands of cloud at different altitudes with spells of sunshine.   Winds 20 -30 mph at summit levels, progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "High pressure with inversion conditions continuing.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There is the potential for a few light snow flurries during the night but in the main it will be dry with a mix of cloud and sunshine during the day.  Fresh North-Easterly winds will gradually ease moderate to light.  Inversion conditions, with freezing levels potentially rising to above the summits during the afternoon; however the air mass over the Cairngorms will remain cool.",
        "SnowStability": "Accumulations of windslab will remain present on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Although moderate and poorly bonded these accumulations will be shallow and generally avoidable. Areas most affected will be gully exits, below coire rims and crag aprons. Elsewhere a widespread crust will overlie the old stable snowpack.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A dry day with bands of cloud at different altitudes and fluctuating temperatures.  Moderate to strong Easterly winds.  Midday summit temperatures of Minus 3 Celsius.",
