The accumulations are fairly small, but some are prone to triggering. Some have also been covered with new snow, making them difficult to recognise.</p><p>On the central part of the southern flank of the Alps and in southern Upper Engadine, the old snowpack structure has been partially transformed, especially in places with little snow, and fractures deeper in the snowpack are possible in isolated cases. In the other regions, the bottom and middle sections of the snowpack are generally favourable, meaning that avalanches usually only involve the upper layers.</p><p>Some medium-sized and occasionally large gliding avalanches are still possible, especially at altitudes between 2000 and 2500 m.</p>"
