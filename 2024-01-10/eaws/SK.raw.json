      "comment" : "The avalanche danger level 2 is declared above the forest zone. Due to the cold air and strong winds of the previous days, dangerous layers of square-grained snow are forming in the cover, or there are hailstones in the cover. These snows are not interbedded with other layers. There is a puffy snow slab on top of them, which creates instability. It is susceptible to the release of a small to medium-sized avalanche with only a small additional load. Especially on steep slopes and of all orientations. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",

Light snow and strong west to northwesterly winds are expected to arrive in the afternoon. This will keep the snow cover unchanged."
