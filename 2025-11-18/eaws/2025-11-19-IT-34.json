The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2500 m. As a consequence of the new snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. In many places there is a danger of falling on the icy crust.",
