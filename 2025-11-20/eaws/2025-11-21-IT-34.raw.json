The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2300 m. As a consequence of the new snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. In many places there is a danger of falling on the icy crust."

The moderate wind has transported some snow. In particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as above approximately 2300 m mostly small wind slabs formed. The old snowpack is faceted and weak. The new snow is bonding only slowly with the old snowpack in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. In all regions from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
