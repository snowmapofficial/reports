These can be released by people and reach medium size. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in steep terrain at high altitude and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. They are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."

      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong northwesterly wind, easily released wind slabs will form in particular from the eastern border of Aran to the southern border of Aran. The fresh wind slabs are bonding poorly with the old snowpack. <br/> Below approximately 1800 m from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
