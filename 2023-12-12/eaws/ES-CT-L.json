        "comment": "As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides are possible by midday. <br/> Over a wide area 10 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until late in the night above approximately 1700 m. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a gathering strong northwesterly wind, dangerous wind slabs will form towards the evening on northeast, southeast and south facing slopes. These can be released by people and reach medium size. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in steep terrain at high altitude and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. They are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
        "highlights": "As the day progresses as a consequence of new snow and stormy weather there will be a gradual increase in the danger of dry avalanches to level 2 (moderate)."
