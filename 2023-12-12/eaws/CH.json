The large quantity of fresh snow and also in particular the wind slabs that are being formed by the westerly wind are prone to triggering. Avalanches can be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach large size in isolated cases. Natural avalanches are possible. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for caution and restraint.\nBelow approximately 2200 m more gliding avalanches are to be expected, even large ones in isolated cases. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. Exposed parts of transportation routes can be endangered.",

At high altitudes, there is about twice as much snow in many areas as there normally is at the beginning of December. The snowpack structure there is generally favourable. Deep in the old snowpack, around older rain crusts there are thin weak layers of angular crystals, which in isolated cases are prone to triggering. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface. There in particular, the older weak layers may be released, including by people in some cases.  <br/>  At intermediate altitudes, the snowpack has been weakened by the rain. It is increasingly stabilising as a consequence of falling temperatures, but gliding avalanches are still possible on slippery ground below 2000 m.</p>"

        "comment": "<h1>Snowpack</h1><p>With rain to high altitudes and snowfall and wind on top of this, avalanches, some of them large, occurred in particular in Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. At high altitudes, there is about twice as much snow in many areas as there normally is at the beginning of December. The snowpack structure there is generally favourable. Deep in the old snowpack, around older rain crusts there are thin weak layers of angular crystals, which in isolated cases are prone to triggering. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface. There in particular, the older weak layers may be released, including by people in some cases.  <br/>  At intermediate altitudes, the snowpack has been weakened by the rain. It is increasingly stabilising as a consequence of falling temperatures, but gliding avalanches are still possible on slippery ground below 2000 m.</p>"
