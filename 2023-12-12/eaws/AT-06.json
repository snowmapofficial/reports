At high altitudes, fresh snowdrifts are accumulating esp. on S/E facing slopes, danger zones are difficult to recognize. A slab avalanche can be triggered by 1 person. At low and intermediate altitudes, increasingly frequent naturally triggered wet-snow and loose-snow avalanches can be expected on very steep slopes in all aspects. On steep grass-covered slopes or smooth rocks, further glide-snow avalanches can be expected, thus, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
