These can still be triggered by individual winter sports enthusiasts in the west, north and east exposures, particularly at transitions from little to a lot of snow and in the entrance areas to snow-covered gullies and hollows. Danger areas due to drifting snow are sometimes thinly covered with snow and difficult to recognise. Occasionally, small sliding snow avalanches can still come loose. Avoid areas underneath sliding snow mounds.",
