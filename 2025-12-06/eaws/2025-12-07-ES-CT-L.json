        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected. On very steep grassy slopes gliding avalanches are possible at any time. Sometimes they are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The no longer entirely fresh wind slabs can be released in isolated cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2500 m. They must be evaluated with care and prudence at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. Early morning: In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",
        "highlights": "Moist snow slides during the day and gliding avalanches require caution. Old wind slabs at elevated altitudes."

The surface of the snowpack is frozen, but not to a significant depth. The fresh snow of the last few days and all the wind slabs are in individual cases still prone to triggering in particular on very steep shady slopes and at elevated altitudes. They remain for the foreseeable future prone to triggering at high altitude. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on very steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
