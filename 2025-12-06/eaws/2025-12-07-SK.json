Above this level, the most serious problem is wind blown snow, where up to 10 cm of new snow has fallen in the last period. This can be wind-blown in the form of snow slabs and pillows on top of older, harder ground, which may not be well bonded. Avalanches are a risk, especially with high additional loads.",
