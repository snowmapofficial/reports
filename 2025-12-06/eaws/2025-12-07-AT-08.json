They have now been blanketed by fresh snowfall, making them difficult to recognize. Small-to-medium sized slab triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts. In addition, slab avalanches can be unleashed in parts of the old snowpack by large additional loading. Caution urged on high-altitude very steep shady slopes. Particularly in zones with rain impact, increasingly frequent small-sized glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
