        "Summary": "NC for 7/12:  Snowpack weakness in isolated areas on NW to NE aspects above 1100m. Cornice collapse during onset of rain. Low Hazard",
        "SnowDistribution": "Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Wet or moist snow at all evaluations by the end of the day. Winds approx 10-15 mph during the day after a wild night. Nb: An overnight gust of 104 mph was recorded on Cairn Gorm summit.",
        "Comment": "Cornices will present a persistent hazard, with an ongoing threat of collapse exacerbated by the onset of rain.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry night is expected, with a period of summit snow and rain in the afternoon. Winds will be moderate South-Westerly, becoming gale force and backing to South-Easterly by the end of the day. The freezing level will be around 1200 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of windslab will remain in steep wind sheltered locations of a North-West to North-East aspect above 1100 metres. Accumulations present lingering weaknesses in isolated areas such as gully tops and coire rims. Outwith these locations the snowpack will be soft, stable and subject to a slow thaw. Cornices will remain fragile and prone to collapse, especially during the onset of rain. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The passage of a front resulted in intense precipitation overnight. Snow initially reached lower levels, while later it was confined to above 1100 metres. The wind was South-Easterly, storm force overnight, moderate in strength during daylight hours. The freezing level was around 1200 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Accumulations of soft windslab are present on North-West to North-East aspects above 1100 metres. Areas such as coire rims and gully tops are particularly affected. Large unstable cornices were observed around gully tops of the same aspect. Below this level the snowpack is generally moist and subject to slow thaw. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Summary": "LO for 7/12. Mild with rain later on. Snowpack will be wet and generally stable. Any existing cornices prone to collapse. Low Hazard",
        "SnowDistribution": "Main snowpack found above 950 metres, not much below this level.  Poor visibility throughout the day on the tops. After a windy night it was generally quite a calm day.",
        "Comment": "Slightly colder conditions expected on Monday before turning mild again on Tuesday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "After a dry night and morning, some rain is expected in the afternoon. The freezing level will be above the summits. Winds will be from the South-East.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to thaw and consolidate in the mild conditions. Stability will generally be good. However, some small cornices exist on North to East aspects above 1100 metres, and these will be prone to collapse.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After some overnight snow accompanied by strong South-Easterly winds it was a generally dry but cloudy day with light winds. The freezing level rose above the summits through the morning.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is starting to slowly thaw and consolidate in the settled conditions. Areas of windslab exist on sheltered North-West to North-East aspects above 1100 metres. However, these are not extensive and are reasonably well bonded. On other aspects, and at lower levels, the snowpack is very shallow. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
