Danger spots are in steep terrain close to the crest with exposures from north-west to north to east as well as in gullies and hollows. The drifting snow can be triggered as a mostly small slab avalanche with a small additional load.\n\nSmall, spontaneous sliding snow avalanches are also possible below 2000 metres. Very steep slopes of all exposures with smooth ground such as meadows, forest aisles and rock slabs are affected. Areas below sliding snow cracks should be avoided."

      "comment" : "Some rain will fall up to medium altitudes, above which it will snow. Loose snow below the snow line will become moist and lose its firmness. At higher altitudes, dry snow will be carried by winds from the west. Fresh and occasionally older drift snow lies mainly on the shady side on softer layers and is susceptible to disruption. On shady slopes at high altitudes, deeper layers of angular crystals can occasionally be found in the snowpack. At mid-altitudes, the snowpack at the transition to the ground is widely wet."
