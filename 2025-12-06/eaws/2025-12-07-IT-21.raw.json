The sometimes large wind slabs of the last few days can be released even by a single winter sport participant in particular on east to south to west facing aspects above approximately 2000 m. This applies in particular on wind-loaded slopes, and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more small and medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible, in particular in case of releases originating from steep sunny starting zones at low and intermediate altitudes that have retained the snow thus far."
