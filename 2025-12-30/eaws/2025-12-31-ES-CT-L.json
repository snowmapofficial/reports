        "comment": "The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep north and west facing slopes. They are sometimes deep and in some cases prone to triggering. Southern and eastern borders of Aran, Adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls: By late in the night small wind slabs will form in particular on east, south and west facing slopes. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In many cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more gliding avalanches are possible as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",
