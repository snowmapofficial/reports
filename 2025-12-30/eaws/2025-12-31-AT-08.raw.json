The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. At very high altitudes in ridgeline terrain, gullies and bowls, freshly generated but usually small-sized snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness."

      "comment" : "The old snowpack surface is generally melt-freeze encrusted, in some places it is iced over. It then softens up slightly on sunny slopes during the daytime hours. On shady slopes there are usually faceted, expansively metamorphosed crystals beneath the melt-freeze crust. At high altitudes, small-sized snowdrifts have been generated over small areas. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. Surface hoar also frequently occurs. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes.  Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
