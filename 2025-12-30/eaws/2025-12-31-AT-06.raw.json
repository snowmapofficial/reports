Especially behind broad ridges and ridgelines as well as in gullies and bowls, these can be triggered by individuals, usually as small slab avalanches. The avalanche prone locations are easily recognisable if visibility is good. Often, some of the snow has covered over the empty areas, so beware of the risk of injury."

In many places, fresh snowdrift accumulations cover soft layers in the transition to the old snow surface. The connection between wind slab and persistent weak layer is poor. On the shady slopes, weak layers of faceted crystals can be found in the old snow foundation. The composition and thickness of the snow cover, snowpack varies greatly in a small area. There is often insufficient old snowpack."

Stormy north-westerly winds and some new fallen snow have created isolated fresh snowdrift accumulations at higher altitudes, which can be triggered as small slab avalanches by even a small additional load. This is particularly the case behind exposed ridges and ridgelines as well as in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are generally easy to recognise. In most cases, the risk of entrainment and injury outweighs the risk of burial."
