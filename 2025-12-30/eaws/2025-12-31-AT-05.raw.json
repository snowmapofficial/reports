Since yesterday, storms from the northwest have deposited fresh wind slab snow on an unfavourably built-up old snow surface. Small avalanches in particular can be triggered by individual people in some places from around 2200 metres. Be especially careful in terrain traps, areas adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit and in gullies and bowls."

Fractures are most possible in fresh wind slab snow, above the hard old snow foundation from early winter, or very rarely in the vicinity of crusts. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."

With new fallen snow and a stormy wind from the northwest, fresh prone-to-triggering snow packs have been forming since yesterday, which can be triggered by individuals in a few places from around 2200 metres. Enough snow could accumulate in isolated terrain traps to bury people. Take care behind exposed ridges and ridgelines, in gullies and bowls. In shady slopes at high altitudes, there are still very few trigger points in persistent weak layers that are difficult to disturb. The risk of injury from stones is not easily recognisable everywhere."
