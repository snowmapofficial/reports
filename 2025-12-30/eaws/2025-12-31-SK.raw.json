The avalanche danger is local, concentrated in places where the wind blows a larger amount of new snow. This is deposited in the form of unstable snow slabs and pillows in gullies, moguls and under rock walls. An avalanche on such steep slopes, where there is still old frozen snow under the new snow, is possible with only a small additional load.",

However, due to strong NW winds, it is being blown to leeward places, where its height reaches 50 cm. In wind-exposed places, the snow surface is blown down to old snow, possibly rocks and grass. Due to the very low temperatures, the new snow cannot bind with the old snow base and remains unstable. Old frozen snow is only found from about 1400-1700 m above sea level (depending on orientation and mountain range). The overall snow depth remains below average, usually less than 50 cm.\nFK"
