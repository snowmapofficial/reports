        "Comment": "Greater accumulations of snow, to lower levels, are expected into New Years Day across the North of Scotland.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A North-Westerly airflow will bring increasing cloud cover overnight and through the day. Showery precipitation during the afternoon will fall as snow above 900 metres as the freezing level rises. Light West-North-Westerly winds will slowly increase moderate to fresh.",
        "SnowStability": "The very patchy snowpack will remain frozen and firm, and will be stable. The largest amounts of snow being on North to East aspects above 950 metres, particularly in sheltered gullies and hollows. Fresh accumulations of snow during the afternoon are not expected to be significant in quantity. Paths, hillsides and rocks will be icy underfoot. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

What remains lies mainly around coire rims, steep slopes and at the tops of gullies above 950 metres on North to East aspects. A general dusting of new snow above 900m by the end of the day.
