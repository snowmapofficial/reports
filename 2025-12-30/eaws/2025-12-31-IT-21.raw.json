The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> <br/> As a consequence of falling temperatures, the natural activity of moist and wet avalanches will appreciably decrease. <br/> <br/> Off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.
