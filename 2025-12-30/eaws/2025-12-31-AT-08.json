On shady slopes there are usually faceted, expansively metamorphosed crystals beneath the melt-freeze crust. At high altitudes, small-sized snowdrifts have been generated over small areas. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. Surface hoar also frequently occurs. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes.  Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
