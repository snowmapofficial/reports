This applies especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Fresh and older wind slabs are bonding poorly with the old snowpack. The wind slabs of the last few days are prone to triggering in all aspects above approximately 2400 m. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow.
