        "comment": "The cold fresh snow and all the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects. This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are sometimes deep and prone to triggering. They are covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong southeasterly wind, further wind slabs will form by Saturday in particular on north and west facing slopes. Sometimes dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The new snow of the last few days can be released naturally in particular on very steep sunny slopes. In the event of solar radiation this applies. <br/> <br/> In particular in regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",
