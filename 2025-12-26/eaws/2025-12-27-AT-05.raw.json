On the one hand, where older wind slab snow has formed a suitable slab over a weak layer in the persistent weak layer. On the other hand, close to the surface in the wind slab of the last few days, which is still prone to triggering. In addition to the risk of burial, the main consideration should be the risk of entrainment."

In high, shady slopes, there is some bondless, angular snow under the melt-freeze crust, which can serve as a weak layer in exceptional cases. The potential for fracture propagation is generally low due to the overall heavily built-up transformed snow cover. Fractures within the snow cover are most possible in the thin wind slab or over the hard old snow foundation from early winter. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
