      <comment>Above approximately 1400 m snow will fall until Monday. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. Above approximately 2300 m medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large natural avalanches are possible. These can be released in deeper layers in particular on very steep shady slopes. &lt;br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation medium-sized natural wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2800 m. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> The more recent wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant. &lt;br/> Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released. Such avalanche prone locations are covered with new snow and are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are very deep. They can be released in the various layers of new snow. &lt;br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm sign.</comment>

      <comment>15 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell during the night above approximately 1800 m. 5 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Monday above approximately 1800 m. &lt;br/> 10 to 15 cm of snow fell on Saturday above approximately 1800 m. &lt;br/> The more recent wind slabs have formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. Towards its surface, the snowpack is unfavourably layered and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust that is not capable of bearing a load. Sunshine and high temperatures gave rise to moistening of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2700 m. As a consequence of highly fluctuating temperatures a crust formed on the surface during the last few days, this also applies on shady slopes below approximately 2000 m. &lt;br/> In particular at intermediate altitudes less snow than usual is lying. On sunny slopes below approximately 2100 m hardly any snow is lying.</comment>
