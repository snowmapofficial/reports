These can be released very easily and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> The somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. These will be covered with new snow and therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow more snow slides are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can be released easily or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."

      "comment" : "Tuesday: The weather will be cloudy over a wide area. 10 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1800 m. The wind will be moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines especially at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. The northerly wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well."
