One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. Less danger on steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible.
