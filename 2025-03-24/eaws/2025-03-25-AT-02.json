Nocturnal outgoing longwave radiation is intermittently reduced. The snowpack is moist. The snowpack will soften increasingly during the course of the day.  In the middle part of the snowpack on N/W/E facing slopes there are faceted, expansively metamorphosed weak layers evident. The freshly generated snowdrift accumulations have been deposited atop unfavorable layers, particularly on shady slopes above 2400m."
