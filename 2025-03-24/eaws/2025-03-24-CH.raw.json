The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes is only superficially moistened. Despite falling temperatures, it is gliding avalanches that are still the most likely, but higher daytime temperatures and sunshine mean that there is also a possibility of isolated wet snow avalanches.</p>"},"tendency":[{"comment":"<h1>Outlook</h1><h2>Tuesday</h2><p>There will be broken cloud in the north and a little snow may fall in the northeast. Conditions will be fairly sunny in Valais and mostly sunny in the south. Temperatures will remain pretty low with light winds. The risk of dry avalanches will slowly decrease. As a result of the sunshine, numerous moist loose snow avalanches are expected, especially in regions with fresh snow in the south. Gliding avalanches remain possible in all regions.</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p>There will be heavy cloud cover in the north with a little snowfall. There will be a slight increase in the risk of dry avalanches. There will be sunny spells in Valais and the south. On the southern flank of the Alps, a foehn wind from the north will develop over the course of the day. Freshly drifted snow will somewhat increase the risk of dry avalanches.
