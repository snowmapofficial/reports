Freshly generated snowdrift accumulations occur mostly near ridges on very steep shady slopes and in gullies and bowls and can be triggered by 1 person above 2400 m, releases mostly small. On very steep N/E/W facing slopes above 2400 m, also weak layers in the old snow can trigger by large additional loading. Slabs can become large-sized if they fracture down to weak layers in the snowpack. \r\nDue to rain impact the snowpack is becoming wetter. In steep grass-covered terrain, naturally triggered wet-snow avalanches are possible at any time, esp. below 2400 m. Glide-snow avalanches are usually medium-sized, occasionally larger higher up.",

        "comment": "Minor fresh snow with wind impact will be deposited atop a moist snowpack surface above 2400 m and bond well. Atop of it the fresh drifts on shady slopes will be deposited atop loose snow which is often a weak layer. On W/N/E facing slopes at high altitudes there are faceted layers near melt-freeze crusts which are trigger-prone in isolated cases. At low and intermediate altitudes the snowpack is already thoroughly wet down to the ground. Hardly any longwave outgoing radiation during the cloudy night. Warmth in the daytime will further weaken the snowpack."
