        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of wind slab will be present above 900m mainly on Northerly to Easterly aspects, with coire rims, gully tops and scarp slopes most  affected. Fresh cornices, overhang these aspects and are new and fragile. Some insignificant limited redistribution onto W aspects may occur.  Below this level, there will be a thin cover mostly lying on bare ground. The old snowpack that lies predominantly on N to E aspects will be firm and stable.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",

Deepest accumulations will be around coire rims, head walls, gullies and crag aprons. In the moderate to fresh winds, some redistributed windslab will begin to form on South-East to South-West aspects above 850 metres, though amounts are not expected to be deep or extensive. The old snowpack exposed to the wind will be frozen and generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Deposits of moderately bonded windslab are present on mainly North to East aspects above 850 metres. Accumulations are deepest in steep locations around coire rims, head walls, gullies and crag aprons. Other aspects are also affected through cross loading. Cornices are prone to collapse. Elsewhere the old snowpack is refrozen and mainly stable. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowStability": "Windslab will accumulate as the day progresses on South-East to South-West aspects above 900 metres. Localised accumulations will contain weaknesses where they overlie the older firm snowpack, e.g. in steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims and multi aspect gully tops. Elsewhere there will be a fresh covering of windblown snow above 600 metres. Cornices will start to develop. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Isolated accumulations of poorly bonded windslab are present on North to East aspects above 900 metres, with additional avoidable pockets on North-West aspects.

Minor weaknesses will persist in isolated and generally avoidable areas of windslab, mainly on steep North to East aspects above 750 metres, particularly where it overlies old snow.
