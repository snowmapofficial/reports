On extremely steep shady slopes above 2000 m, isolated small slab avalanches can still be triggered in the old snow, esp. with large additional loading in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls. At intermediate altitudes \u00f6on extremely steep slopes in all aspects, naturally triggered wet-snow/glide-snow avalanches are possible which can reach medium size. Beware potential starting zones.",
