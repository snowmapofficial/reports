On shady slopes, isolated snowdrift patches can be prone to triggering. Elsewhere there is dry powder atop a compact snowpack. On shady slopes where snow is shallow, isolated layers of faceted crystals have persisted inside the snowpack. Tests confirm that the snowpack is stable."

At high altitudes, small-area snowdrift accumlations can be prone to triggering as slab avalanches even by one sole person, esp. on very steep ridgeline terrain on NW/N/E facing slopes.
