At high altitudes on shady slopes the upper layers are often still powdery. Overnight on sunny slopes and at lower altitudes, a melt-freeze crust forms, often breakable crusts. With daytime warming, the snowpack forfeits its firmness and becomes weaker as it becomes wetter. The below-average snowpack is all-in-all well consolidated."
