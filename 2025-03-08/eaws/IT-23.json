Avalanches can be released in the old snowpack by large loads. <br/> There is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface, in particular on very steep sunny slopes. <br/> New snow in the evening. 15 to 30 cm of snow, and up to 40 cm in some localities, will fall until Monday above approximately 1500 m. The maximum amounts of fresh snow will be reached in the areas bordering Piedmont. The wind will be moderate to strong. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase during the course of the night.",
        "highlights": "The snow sport conditions outside marked and open pistes remain quite favourable. In the evening as a consequence of new snow and strong wind there will be an increase in the avalanche danger."
