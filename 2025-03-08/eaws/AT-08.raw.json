Isolated triggerings of small avalanches can be released by persons in extremely steep terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. Due to warmth and solar radiation, moist slids and small wet-snow avalanches are possible esp. on steep sunny slopes during the course of the day. On steep grass-covered slopes with ample snow or on smooth ground, increasingly frequent small glide-snow avalanches are possible."

      "comment" : "Storm strength southerly foehn winds will generate trigger sensitive snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes. Due to mild temperatures, near-surface layers will lose their firmness and the snowpack will moisten/become wet down to intermediate altitudes, weakening further. At high altitudes on shady slopes the upper layers are often still powdery. Overnight on sunny slopes and at lower altitudes, a melt-freeze crust forms, often breakable crusts. With daytime warming, the snowpack forfeits its firmness and becomes weaker as it becomes wetter. The below-average snowpack is all-in-all well consolidated."
