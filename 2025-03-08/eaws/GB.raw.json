        "Summary": "CM for 9.3. Thaw conditions. Snowpack generally moist and stable. Threat of cornice and rockfall remain. Avalanche Hazard Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in specific places such as high coires and Northerly aspects. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells in the glens. Winds generally 10-15mph.",
        "Comment": "As the thaw continues the threat of rockfall will remain from steep crags, such as those in Coire Ardair. Decaying cornices also pose a lingering threat.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry period is expected with mostly moderate South-Easterly winds overnight. Following a period of near calm, light winds will follow veering to the West-North-West by the end of the period. The freezing level will be 2000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected as the thaw continues. The snowpack will remain moist and well bonded in most locations, continuing to deplete in extent. The greatest areas of patchy snow will be found on steep North through East to South-East aspects above 850 metres. Residual cornices will remain in some locations of the same aspect. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light overnight rain was followed by a generally dry day. Winds were moderate South-Easterlies. The freezing level was well above the highest summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining snowpack is patchy, mostly being confined to slopes of a North through East to South-East aspect above 850 metres. Some ribbons of snow extend to lower elevations in some shallow gully lines. The snow is soft at all altitudes and exhibits good stability in most locations. Some ragged cornices remain, posing a lingering threat of collapse. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Largest areas of snow will be encountered in the steep North-West to North-East facing corries above 900 metres and on a few selected East facing slopes on the highest mountains. Most terrain will be free from snow.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
