        "comment": "In the High, Western and Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree). Due to snowfall combined with a very strong south wind, snow slabs have formed mainly in the northern orientations. Avalanche release on very steep, is possible especially with a large additional load. Caution, on some slopes, especially in the north, there is a layer of dangerous square-grained snow under the new snow. At lower elevations, the snow has been soaked and therefore hardened and stabilized by the impact of the hardening.",
