Especially here avalanches can be triggered in the faceted old snow and reach medium size. <br/> Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in places that are protected from the wind. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized loose snow avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of solar radiation."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"In some regions 20 to 40 cm of snow has fallen above approximately 1200 m. As a consequence of a strong wind from southerly directions, soft wind slabs formed. These are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack above approximately 2000 m. This applies especially in shady places that are protected from the wind. The old snowpack is faceted.
