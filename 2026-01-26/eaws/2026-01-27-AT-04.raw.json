      "comment" : "On Monday, the sun will shine more frequently in the mountains at first. As the daytime changes, the clouds will thicken and visibility will be limited. Light snow showers are then possible in the afternoon. The wind will blow mainly weak to moderate from westerly directions. Temperatures at 1500 metres will be around -3 degrees, at 2000 metres around -5 degrees.\nTuesday will bring mostly friendly mountain weather. In the late afternoon, increasingly compact layered clouds will gather from the west and make visibility quite diffuse. The wind will be mostly weak, with moderate winds from the south to east on the Alpine peaks. Temperatures will be around 2 degrees at 1500 metres and 0 degrees at 2000 metres by midday."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is low. However, there are local avalanche prone locations to be aware of.  In the north and east sectors, individual slab avalanches can be triggered in places in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines, at terrain transitions and in steep bowls and gullies with low additional loads. Localised small-scale displacements must be taken into account."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Depending on the aspect and hardness of the surface, the snowpack varies in hardness and is partly icy. Despite strong winds, there is hardly any new drifting and, if at all, only traces of new fallen snow. The snowpack contains faceted crystals and/or floating snow, especially in high alpine areas. This means that slab avalanches can easily be triggered here. Mostly at higher altitudes, there may be small-scale, sometimes disturbing drifts. In general, there is very little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to many apery and completely blown-off areas, there are also well-filled areas."
