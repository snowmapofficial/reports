The sun will shine frequently, especially in the morning, but as the day progresses, high and medium-high cloud fields will increasingly cloud the sky. Visibility is good, but can become quite diffuse in the afternoon. In the high altitudes of the Hohe Tauern, there will be a lively southerly foehn with gusts of up to 50 km/h, otherwise the wind will be rather light. Temperatures will rise from -5 to 1 degree at 2000 metres and from -11 to -5 degrees at 3000 metres."

Both fresh and older drift snowpacks as well as the weakly built-up old snowpack can be disturbed, fractures can tear through. Avalanche prone locations increase rapidly from the tree line upwards. They are concentrated from west to north to east, in some places in the southern sector in the high Alps, and generally next to blown-off areas. Drift snow areas and the transition from little to more snow should be avoided. Whumpfing collapsing sounds when stepping on the snowpack can indicate danger."

The old snowpack consists of crusts with faceted crystals in between and deep rime. A break usually occurs around the uppermost crust. The total snow depth is well below average."
