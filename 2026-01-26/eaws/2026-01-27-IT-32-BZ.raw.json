The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Saturday. As a consequence of a strong wind from southerly directions, soft wind slabs formed. These are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack above the tree line. The old snowpack is faceted and weak.
