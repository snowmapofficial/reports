Strong gale force winds, initially East-South-East, veering through the day to the South-South-East.\nObservedSnowStability: Snowfall and constant drifting have continued to build unstable windslab in wind sheltered locations on West to North aspects above 900 metres. South-West aspects and some North-East aspects have also been affected. Moderately bonded accumulations are present below this altitude and above 600 metres.
