Other isolated danger zones are located in extremely steep, predominantly shady terrain. In isolated cases, small avalanches can be triggered in these places in the old snow. Such danger zones are located particularly in transitions from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution.",

It is possible to trigger slab avalanches in the old snow particularly by large additional loading.  If a release sweeps away the entire snowpack the avalanche can grow to medium size. Danger zones are located especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers.",
