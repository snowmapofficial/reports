This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are sometimes deep and prone to triggering. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate southeasterly wind, further wind slabs will form by Boxing Day in particular on north and west facing slopes. Sometimes dry avalanches are medium-sized. In particular in regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"30 to 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last few days above approximately 1500 m. Sunny slopes low and intermediate altitudes: As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation the snowpack settled until the middle of the day. Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: The new snow and wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> Boxing Day: Some snow will fall until the early morning. The southeasterly wind will transport the new snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Saturday: The danger of dry avalanches will not decrease for the time being.
