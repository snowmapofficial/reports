The continuous snow cover in the Low Tatras occurs from an altitude of about 1300 m and reaches 40 to 70 cm at the highest altitudes. In the Western and High Tatras there is snow from about 1600 m above sea level and its height is only up to 40 cm. In the north and in shady localities there is sometimes loose, square-grained snow in the snow cover."
