This occurs where the older foehn drift snow has formed a suitable shelf above a weak layer (usually in persistent weak layer). In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of falling and injury should be taken into account."

      "comment" : "A little new fallen snow lies on a hard-frozen surface. On the sunny slopes, the snow cover, snowpack softens during the daytime changes. In high, shady slopes, the melt-freeze crust is partly covered by edged snow with no binding, which can serve as a weak layer in exceptional cases, but usually does not tend to propagate fractures. Fractures are most possible within the snow cover, above the hardness of the old snow foundation from early winter or in weak layers near crusts. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
