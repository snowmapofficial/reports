In high, shady slopes, the melt-freeze crust is partly covered by edged snow with no binding, which can serve as a weak layer in exceptional cases, but usually does not tend to propagate fractures. Fractures are most possible within the snow cover, above the hardness of the old snow foundation from early winter or in weak layers near crusts. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
