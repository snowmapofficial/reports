      "comment" : "In the Western Tatras, in the western part of the High Tatras and in the Mala Fatra there is an CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in high altitudes, 3rd degree.  During the last snowfall 20 - 40 cm of powder snow fell in the region. Due to strong south winds, the snow was transported to the leeward slopes of the northern exposures, where unstable snow slabs, pillows and overhangs are formed. On steep slopes, avalanche release is already possible with a small additional load (one skier). Occasionally, smaller and medium-sized spontaneous avalanches can also occur. The southerly flow has also brought strong warming, which also has an adverse effect on the snow cover, especially at low and medium altitudes (up to 1800 m a.s.l.) On very steep slopes, smaller avalanches from wet snow are expected to occur, both with mechanical loads and spontaneously.",
