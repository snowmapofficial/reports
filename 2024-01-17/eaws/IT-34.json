        "comment": "Over a wide area 15 to 25 cm of snow will fall until Friday above approximately 2000 m. As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, wind slabs will form in particular in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> At high altitude the wind slabs are larger. <br/> Fresh wind slabs are to be assessed with care and prudence. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. <br/> Isolated whumpfing sounds can indicate the danger.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger."
