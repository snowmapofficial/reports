In the west, this layer mostly no longer exists because the rain on Wednesday soaked it down to around 2200 m. Above this altitude and in the other regions, where there was little or no rain on Wednesday, the weak layer is still present and prone to triggering, especially on slopes that are largely sheltered from the wind. With the expected arrival of fresh snow, avalanches triggered or occurring naturally in this weak layer may be larger than before.</p><p>There are hardly any critical weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>As the snowfall level drops, wet avalanche activity will decrease.</p>"

        "comment": "<h1>Snowpack</h1><p>The old snow surface from last week, angular in structure and partly covered with surface hoar, has in recent days become a weak near-surface layer prone to triggering in many places as a result of the wind and some new snow. In the west, this layer mostly no longer exists because the rain on Wednesday soaked it down to around 2200 m. Above this altitude and in the other regions, where there was little or no rain on Wednesday, the weak layer is still present and prone to triggering, especially on slopes that are largely sheltered from the wind. With the expected arrival of fresh snow, avalanches triggered or occurring naturally in this weak layer may be larger than before.</p><p>There are hardly any critical weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>As the snowfall level drops, wet avalanche activity will decrease.</p>"
