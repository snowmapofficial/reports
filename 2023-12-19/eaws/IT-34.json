        "comment": "The wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. In some cases avalanches are medium-sized and can be released even by a single winter sport participant. As a consequence of warming, the likelihood of moist loose snow avalanches being released will increase a little in particular on very steep sunny slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular on very steep shady slopes. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes in particular above approximately 2400 m.",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs represent the main danger. As a consequence of warming there will be an increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches."
