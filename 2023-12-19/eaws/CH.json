These are prone to triggering.</p><p>Deeper in the snowpack, there are sometimes weak layers in the area of older rain crusts.

In southern Upper Valais, Ticino, Moesano, Val Bregaglia and Val Poschiavo, older weak layers are less covered and may occasionally be released by people.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially below 2400 m.
