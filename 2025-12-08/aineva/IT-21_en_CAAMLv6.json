The sometimes deep wind slabs of the last few days can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases in particular on east to south to west facing aspects above approximately 2000 m. This applies in particular on wind-loaded slopes, and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more small and medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible, in particular in case of releases originating from steep sunny starting zones that have retained the snow thus far."
