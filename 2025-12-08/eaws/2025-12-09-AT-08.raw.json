Wet-snow avalanches can also be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. At high altitudes, fresh, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been generated. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. In addition, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places in the old snow by large additional loading. Caution urged on high-altitude very steep shady slopes."

On Monday, numerous small, but also several medium and, in isolated cases, also large naturally triggered avalanches were reported. Above 2200m there was 30cm of fresh snow registered. As a result of strong-velocity winds it was transported and fresh snowdrift accumulations were generated. These are prone to triggering. At high altitudes, particularly on shady slopes, faceted intermediate layers are evident inside the snowpack. In places, these can be triggered."
