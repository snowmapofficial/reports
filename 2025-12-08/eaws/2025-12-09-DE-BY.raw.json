Wet sliding snow avalanches slide off spontaneously on very steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged. Where there is still snow on extremely steep terrain, it can slide off or be triggered as a loose snow avalanche, especially on the south side. Wet snow avalanches usually remain small.\n\nDrift snow can be problematic in the highest summit and ridge areas. Danger spots can be found in the steep terrain close to the crest in the northern exposures. Accumulations of drifting snow can be triggered as mostly small slab avalanches with a small additional load."

      "comment" : "The snow cover has become wet up to high altitudes. It only freezes superficially at night in open areas protected from the wind. With warm temperatures and sunshine, the remaining snow cover soaks quickly during the day and loses its firmness. Sliding movements occur on smooth surfaces. At the highest altitudes, layers of angular crystals that are susceptible to disruption are occasionally preserved on the shaded side. This is particularly the case in the area of older drift snow accumulations."
