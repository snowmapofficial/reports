Fresh wind slabs at the southern border of Aran.","comment":"On very steep grassy slopes gliding avalanches are possible at any time. Sometimes they are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. They can be released by people or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Especially at the southern border of Aran small wind slabs will form. The fresh wind slabs can in some cases be released easily. <br/> In addition the old wind slabs of the last few days in the vicinity of peaks are capable of being triggered in very isolated cases still. <br/> <br/> Early morning: In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack on sunny slopes in all altitude zones. Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will hardly soften at all. In particular high altitudes: The southwesterly wind will transport the loosely bonded old snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Gradual decrease in danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides as the temperature drops.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-09T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-10T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-09"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","SW","SE","S","E","W"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["SW","SE","S","E","W"]},{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","E"]}],"bulletinID":"1a74ec81-2eda-4dc1-b747-f53599cf6548","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
