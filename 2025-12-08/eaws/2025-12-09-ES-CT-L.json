        "comment": "On very steep grassy slopes gliding avalanches are possible at any time. Sometimes they are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. They can be released by people or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Especially at the southern border of Aran small wind slabs will form. The fresh wind slabs can in some cases be released easily. <br/> In addition the old wind slabs of the last few days in the vicinity of peaks are capable of being triggered in very isolated cases still. <br/> <br/> Early morning: In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",

In particular high altitudes: The southwesterly wind will transport the loosely bonded old snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
