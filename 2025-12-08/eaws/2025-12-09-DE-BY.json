Wet sliding snow avalanches slide off spontaneously on very steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged. Where there is still snow on extremely steep terrain, it can slide off or be triggered as a loose snow avalanche, especially on the south side. Wet snow avalanches usually remain small.\n\nDrift snow can be problematic in the highest summit and ridge areas. Danger spots can be found in the steep terrain close to the crest in the northern exposures. Accumulations of drifting snow can be triggered as mostly small slab avalanches with a small additional load.",
