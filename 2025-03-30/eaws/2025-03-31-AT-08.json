During the nighttime hours and in early morning, another 10-20cm of fresh snow is anticipated, in Bregenzerwald up to 40cm, which will be transported by brisk-to-strong N/NW winds. The old snowpack is thoroughly wet up to high altitudes. The weight of the fresh fallen snow enhances gliding movements over smooth ground."
