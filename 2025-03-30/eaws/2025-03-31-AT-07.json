The new snow and wind slabs will be deposited on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used west, north and east facing slopes. This applies in particular above approximately 2200 m."
