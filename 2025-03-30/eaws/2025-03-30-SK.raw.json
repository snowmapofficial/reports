      "comment" : "In the high altitudes of the High, Western and Low Tatras there is a low avalanche danger (1.degree). The arrival of rainfall has caused a decrease in the stability of the snow cover to a height of about 2000 m above sea level. Above this level it will be mostly snow. However, the amount of precipitation will be only up to 10 mm. Small avalanches and drifts of wet snow may occur.It will get colder during the day and the snow will harden and harden towards the evening. At high altitudes, in couloirs, under saddles and rock faces, there are still snow slabs and pillows on the northern, shaded slopes, which can mean avalanche release with a large additional load. However, there are very few such locations.",
