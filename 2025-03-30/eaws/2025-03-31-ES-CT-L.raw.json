      "comment" : "As a consequence of a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, precarious wind slabs formed. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Some occasionally large avalanches are further to be expected. Especially shady slopes and transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack: These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase. These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur."

      "comment" : "Monday: The weather will be mostly sunny. The wind will be moderate adjacent to ridgelines especially at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. <br/> <br/> In particular shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: Wind slabs are lying on old snow containing large grains. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> The conditions are treacherous for backcountry touring. Careful route selection and spacing between individuals are recommended."
