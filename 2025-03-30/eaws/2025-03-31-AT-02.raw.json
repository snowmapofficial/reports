      "highlights" : "Avoid fresh snowdrift accumulations",
      "comment" : "Due to fresh fallen snow and strong-to-stormy northerly winds, further snowdrift accumulations are being generated esp. in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the terrain. Avalanches can be triggered in the weak old snow by one sole skier. Danger zones occur esp. on W/N/E-facing slopes above 2200m. Isolated danger zones also lie on south-facing slopes above 2600m. Avalanches can also be triggered in the near-surface layers of the snowpack in all aspects above 2200m. The releases can fracture down to deeper layers and thereby grow to medium size. Due to snowfall, increasingly frequent loose-snow avalanches can be expected, mostly small releases."

      "comment" : "Since Saturday, 20-40cm of fresh snow has been registered above 1700m, locally up to 60cm. The often storm strength winds will transport the fresh snow intensively. Inside the old snowpack on N/W/E-facing slopes there are faceted, expansively metamorphosed  weak layers. The fresh snowdrifts lie deposited atop soft layers above 2000m."
