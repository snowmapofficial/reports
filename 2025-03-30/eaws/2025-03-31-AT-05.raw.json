From tomorrow until Tuesday morning, 30-60cm of fresh snowfall is expected at high altitudes, winds will reach 70 km/hr and transport the fresh fallen snow. At 2000m: -6 degrees; at 3000M. -13 degrees."

      "comment" : "Avalanche danger above 2200m is HIGH. The situation is dangerous for winter sports enthusiasts, slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading and grow to medium size, also isolated naturally triggered avalanches from ridgeline snowdrifts are possible. Near-surface slab avalanches in fresh snow and drifts can fracture down to deeper layers above 2200m on W/N/E-facing slopes and grow to large size. Due to solar radiation in afternoon hours, naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches can be expected. Avalanches released at higher altitudes can fracture down to deeper layers and then plummet down to green zones. Especially above the timberline, small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in very steep grass-covered terrain."

      "comment" : "Since Friday evening 30-50cm of fresh snow has been registered at high altitudes. By Monday evening another 30-60cm is anticpated. Winds will be strong-to-stormy from the northwest. Inside the fresh snow and snowdrifts there are soft layers of loose snow or graupel. In the lower and middle parts of the snowpack above 2200m there are weak layers of faceted crystals which are embedded between cdrusts. Below 2000m the old snow is moist."
