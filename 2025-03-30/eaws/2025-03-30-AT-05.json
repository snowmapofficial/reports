With increasing amounts of fresh fallen snow, avalanche danger above 2200m will rise to CONSIDERABLE. Avalanches can in some zones be triggered by one sole skier, esp. in the afternoon, and grow to medium size. Danger zones occur in the old snow on north-facing slopes above 2200m, in all aspects above 2400m. Fresh snowdrift accumulations occur both near to and distant from ridgelines, behind protruberances in the terrain, and in gullies and bowls. Particularly below 2000m the old snowpack is thoroughly wet and small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible. Avalanches in high altitudes can sweep along more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and in isolated cases plummet all the way down to the green zones. Small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in very to extremely steep grass-covered terrain.",

Danger zones for small slab avalanches in the snowdrifts occur seldom on very steep north-facing slopes at high altitudes. On steep grass-covered slopes, isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall demand adequate consideration.small wet loose-snow avalanches are possible in very-to-extremely steep terrain in all aspects. The gliding snow activity will increase, small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible on steep grass-covered slopes. Above 2300m, only few danger zones where still small dry slab avalanches can be triggered.
