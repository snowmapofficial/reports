        "comment": "The cold fresh snow and all the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects. This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are barely possible to recognise and prone to triggering. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from variable directions, further wind slabs will form by the middle of the day in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. Sometimes dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",

The new snow and wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered west, north and east facing slopes and at intermediate and high altitudes. Released avalanches and field observations confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
