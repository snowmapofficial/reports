This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are barely possible to recognise and prone to triggering. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from variable directions, further wind slabs will form by the middle of the day in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. Sometimes dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Sunday above approximately 1500 m. Southernmost and easternmost part of Aran In particular high altitudes and places that are protected from the wind: The moderate wind has transported the new snow. The new snow and wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered west, north and east facing slopes and at intermediate and high altitudes. Released avalanches and field observations confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Christmas Day: As a consequence of new snow and wind, further wind slabs will form.
