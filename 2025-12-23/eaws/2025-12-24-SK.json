The snow cover has stabilised due to the change in temperature. During the day, spontaneous avalanches of new snow may occur sporadically, but there will be very little of it.",

        "comment": "The inverse situation of the last few days has changed. It has cooled down. This has created a hard, often load-bearing, firn on the surface of the snow cover. Up to 5 cm of new snow is expected to be added. Continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1300 m and reaches 40 to 70 cm at the highest altitudes. In the Western and High Tatras there is snow from about 1600 m above sea level and its height is only up to 40 cm."
