This applies especially on steep shady slopes above the tree line. <br/> Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. Mostly the avalanches are otherwise small. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from easterly directions, sometimes avalanche prone wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area up to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1200 m. <br/> The new snow will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. Shady slopes above approximately 2400 m: Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> Below approximately 2400 m: The snowpack is largely stable. Hardly any snow is lying on south facing slopes. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations.
