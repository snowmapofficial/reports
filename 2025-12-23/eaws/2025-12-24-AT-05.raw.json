This occurs where the older foehn drift snow has formed a suitable shelf above a weak layer (usually in persistent weak layer). In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of falling and injury should be taken into account."

Fractures are most possible within the snow cover, above the hardness of the old snowpack from early winter or in weak layers near crusts. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
