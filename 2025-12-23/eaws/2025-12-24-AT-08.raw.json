The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. At very high altitudes over minor areas, freshly generated but small-sized snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness."

South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
