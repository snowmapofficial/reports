      "comment" : "In all high mountains of Slovakia there is only a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. The situation is stable, the older snow cover is melted and hardened. Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in positions above the forest zone - on very steep slopes with packed snow. This locally forms snow slabs and pillows.",

      "comment" : "There is a continuous snow cover mainly at the highest altitudes above 1500m above sea level. Its surface is mostly hard snow or firn. Locally, ice sheets occur. Below the ridges and on the leeward slopes, there is newer snow on its surface in the form of snow slabs. This is not cohesive with the hard ground. In the northern shady gullies and moguls, locally dry powder snow up to 20cm. In valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice covered with newer snow."
