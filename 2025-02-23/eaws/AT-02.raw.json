In the Gurktal Alps, Saualpe and Koralpe, and Karawanken, the dispersal of clouds will need until midday. Initially, light snowfall or rainfall.  In the afternoon, some peaks will disappear in fog, local showers are expected. Light westerly winds, temperatures dropping slightly. At 2000m: -2 degrees, at 3000m: -7 degrees.

      "comment" : "Weak layers in the old snow can be triggered in very isolated cases by one sole skier on steep W/N/E facing slopes above 2300m. Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. These danger zones occur seldom. Avalanche releases tend to be small-sized. Small wet loose-snow avalanches are still possible. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses."

      "comment" : "Shady slopes above 2300m: in the lowermost part of the snowpack there are faceted, expansively metamorphosed weak layers, esp. on W/N/E facing slopes. Sunny slopes and slopes at low and intermediate altitudes: the uppermost part of the snowpack is moist, regionally wet. This situation is softening the snowpack particularly at low and intermediate altitudes. Highly varied snowpack. There is too little snow on the ground for this juncture of the season."
