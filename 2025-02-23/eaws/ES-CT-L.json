        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more mostly small wet and gliding avalanches are possible. Especially in the south the moist avalanches can reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads, on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring calls for defensive route selection.",

In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
