Especially in the south the moist avalanches can reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads, on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring calls for defensive route selection."

      "comment" : "In particular in the eastern area of Aran up to 10 cm of snow fell on Saturday above approximately 2200 m. Faceted weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
