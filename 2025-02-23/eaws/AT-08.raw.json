Otherwise, avalanche danger is low. Small wet loose-snow avalanches are possible on sunny extrmely steep slopes. Isolated avalanche triggerings by winter sports enthusiasts are possible in extremely steep terrain.  Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration."

In high altitude pass and ridgeline zones, small fresh, often trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness. Esp. on steep shady slopes these drifts have been deposited atop loose snow and are prone to triggering. High-altitude shady slopes are often still powdery, elsewhere the snowpack is often with breakable crusts, sometimes wind crusts are capable of bearing loads. On sunny slopes, a melt-freeze crust. During the daytime hours, this crust softens up again. In recent days increasingly frequent fresh glide cracks and glide-snow avalanches have been reported."
