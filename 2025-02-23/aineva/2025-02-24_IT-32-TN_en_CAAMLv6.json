The avalanche prone locations are to be found on extremely steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> The hard wind slabs are mostly small and can only be released in isolated cases, this applies in particular in case of a large load. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on near-ridge shady slopes. They are easy to recognise. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep sunny slopes only isolated mostly small wet loose snow slides are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation."

      "comment" : "Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes. The hard wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes. They can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface has a crust that is barely capable of bearing a load. The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to gradual softening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. This also applies at low and intermediate altitudes in all aspects. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be moist at low and intermediate altitudes. Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
