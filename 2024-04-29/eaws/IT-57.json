        "comment": "As a consequence of warming individual moist and wet avalanches are possible from the late morning, but they will be mostly small. The avalanches can occur naturally as well. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially in extremely steep terrain at high altitude and in steep rocky terrain.",
        "highlights": "Wet snow represents the main danger."

        "comment": "At intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. At high altitude only a little snow is lying. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. The solar radiation will give rise from early morning to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack. The meteorological conditions will bring about a weakening of the snowpack in particular in steep terrain that is interspersed with rocks."
