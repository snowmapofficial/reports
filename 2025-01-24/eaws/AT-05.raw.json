      "comment" : "Avalanche danger is low, the major danger stems from snowdrifts. Particularly on very steep shady slopes above the timberline, small slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated cases by minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur also distant from ridges, behind protruberances and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, particularly on W/N/E facing slopes. On steep shady slopes, fractures down to more deeply embedded layers are possible, thus making avalanches grow larger. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow. Isolated naturally triggered glide-snow and loose-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night."

      "comment" : "Small snowdrift accumulations lie deposited atop a faceted, expansively metamorphosed snowpack surface on shady slopes. Away from these the snowpack in wind-protected zones is quite rewarding for skies, consisting of faceted expansively metamorphosed powder, with surface hoar evident in some places. In wind-exposed terrain the surface is highly varied, foehn conditions are slowly taking shape on steep sunny slopes. Due to mild temperatures the snowpack softens up during the daytime. Through warm up to high altitudes, the entire snowpack can start to glide over the ground."
