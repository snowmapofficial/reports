        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. Snowdrifts can be problematic. In some places at high altitude, snowdrift accumulations can trigger small slab avalanches even by the weight of one single skier. Danger zones occur in very steep ridgeline terrain on NW/N/E facing slopes and in gullies and bowls.  Dangers of being swept away and of taking a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",
        "highlights": "Snowpack stable far and wide. Risks of falling on a hard, icy snowpack should not be underestimated."

        "comment": "Wherever nocturnal skies clear up the snowpack surface tends to freeze. During the course of the day the snow becomes superficially moist, particularly on very steep sunny slopes, and thereby forfeits its firmness. In shady and wind-exposed terrain the snowpack surface can remain frozen all day long. On north-facing slopes at high altitudes there are few snowdrift accumulations lying deposited atop loosely-packed layers. The snowpack is stable and free of weak layers, by and large. On south-facing slopes the ground is bare widespread at intermediate altitudes. All in all, there is little snow on the ground."
