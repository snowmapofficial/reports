        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs are mostly small and in some cases prone to triggering. They are to be found in particular on north and east facing slopes and in the high Alpine regions. Avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow also. In isolated cases these are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/>",

In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
