Avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow also. In isolated cases these are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/>"

      "comment" : "Especially at the southern and western borders of Aran 5 to 10 cm of snow has fallen since Tuesday above approximately 2200 m. The wind was moderate to strong in the vicinity of peaks. <br/> <br/> The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
