It is succession of soft layers on the surfaces, partially powder snow, and faceted snow crystals with melt-freeze crusts."

On shady slopes the snow cover is built by faceted snow crystals and the layers are poorly bonded. On the surface a powdery snow layer can be found, underneath that weak layers are forming which are destabilizing the snow base. The snow cover is in general unusually thin, considering the season. Only in blown-in gullies and bowls compact snow packs with a higher amount of snow are found."
