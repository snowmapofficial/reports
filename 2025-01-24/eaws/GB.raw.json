Freezing level will be lower generally tomorrow at around 400 metres, giving snow fall to lower elevations. The winds will slowly moderate during the day and will have a general Westerly characteristic. As the wind lessen from Storm Force it will move snow more efficiently into wind sheltered locations allowing depth to build up on North to East aspects of the mountains.",
