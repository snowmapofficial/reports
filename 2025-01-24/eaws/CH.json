The westerly to southwesterly winds continue. The snowdrift accumulations are often easily triggered, especially where the surface of the snowpack was faceted and loose before the precipitation. This was particularly the case on shady, steep slopes that are protected from the wind and tend to be at a distance from ridgelines. Particularly adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas, the surface of the snowpack was otherwise strongly shaped by the wind and therefore irregular and often hard. Otherwise, the snowpack structure varies from region to region:</p><ul><li>North of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine and in the extreme west of Lower Valais: The middle part of the snowpack is often well consolidated and therefore there is little expectation that avalanches will be triggered deep in the old snowpack.</li><li>South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine: Particularly in areas with little snow in the south and east, the entire snowpack is faceted and loose in places. Isolated avalanches may still be triggered in weak layers if there is still a sufficiently pronounced snow slab above.</li></ul>"
