        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate above 1500 m. Fresh snow and with ascending altitude increasingly large snowdrift accumulations can trigger a small slab avalanche. Danger zones occur on steep ridgeline slopes and in gullies and bowls. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow, also the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall need to be considered. In steep terrain, forest lands and on grassy slopes, glide-snow avalanches can be expected in all aspects, reaching small-to-medium size. ",

Danger zones occur in steep wind-loaded terrain and behind protruberances, as well as in gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Lower layers in the snowpack can be triggered mostly by large additional loading, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. entries into gullies and bowls. Below 2200 m glide-snow avalanches can be expected in extremely steep terrain, forest lanes and on smooth grassy slopes which have not yet discharged, becoming large with ascending altitude. Exposed zones can be placed at risk thereby. Caution below glide cracks. ",
