Weak layers lurk inside the snowdrifts and soft layers in the form of faceted crystals, esp. in transitions to the old snow. At intermediate altitudes the drifts are better bonded with the old snowpack.Due to rain impact the snowpack is often wet at intermediate altitudes, can glide over the ground on very steep slopes."
