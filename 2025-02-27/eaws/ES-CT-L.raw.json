The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. Mostly they are small but in some cases easily released. Released avalanches and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack have shown poor snowpack stability on very steep north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. The wind slabs will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise."

The wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. On Friday it will be sunny at times. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying."
