        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. At high altitudes small-scale snowdrifts can be triggered in particular by large additional loading. The few avalanche prone locations occur in steep ridgeline terrain in N/E aspects. Avalanche releases are mostly small-sized, but can reach medium size in isolated cases in the Allg\u00e4u and the Berchtesgaden Alps. The new snow of the last few days can also be triggered as small loose snow avalanches in extremely steep terrain due to solar radiation. On very steep slopes with sufficient snow over smooth ground small glide-snow avalanches cannot be excluded.",

        "comment": "In some places at high altitude shallow snowdrifts are still prone to triggering. Elsewhere the snow has mostly well solidified. In the Werdenfels region the snowpack surface is frequently hard in shady high altitude terrain, and only in some patches it is blanketed by a few centimeters of loose snow. In regions that saw heavy snowfall during the last few days such as Berchtesgaden or main Allg\u00e4u ridge there is powder snow on high altitude shady slopes. The old snowpack is stable, at intermediate altitude thoroughly moist and wet down to the ground."
