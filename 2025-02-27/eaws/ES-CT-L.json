        "comment": "The no longer entirely fresh wind slabs of Wednesday must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. Mostly they are small but in some cases easily released. Released avalanches and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack have shown poor snowpack stability on very steep north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. The wind slabs will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise.",
