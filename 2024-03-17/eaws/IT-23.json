        "comment": "A mostly overcast night: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust only at high altitudes and will already be soft in the early morning. This applies in particular below approximately 2400 m. Until the temperature falls more medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2500 m, caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls, as well as on very steep sunny slopes. <br/> Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be started and concluded early. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as above approximately 2500 m. They can especially at their margins be released, even by a single winter sport participant. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and wet snow represent the main danger. Moist avalanches and wet and gliding avalanches are still possible."

The wind will be moderate to strong. <br/> The weather conditions will give rise to moistening of the snowpack especially at low and intermediate altitudes. <br/> The snowpack is dry; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow. This applies on shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. <br/> <br/> A lot of snow is lying at intermediate and high altitudes. <br/> In the last few days on very steep sunny slopes several medium-sized to large avalanches were observed."
