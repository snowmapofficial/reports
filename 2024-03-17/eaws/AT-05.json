In high/high-alpine regions snowdrifts can trigger a slab (small-to-medium), most danger zones are easily recognized, lie neaer to and distant from ridges, behind discontinuities and in gullies. Most danger zones are on NW/N/SE facing steep slopes, also on south-facing slopes in high-alpine terrain. Above 2400 m, esp. on shady slopes, weak layers can be triggered by large additional loading and releases occasionally grow to large size.",
