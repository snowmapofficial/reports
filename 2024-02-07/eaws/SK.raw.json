Dangerous places are windward (SE, E and SW) high mountain gullies and terrain depressions, where strong wind blows the last remnants of loose snow from the previous snowfall. In such places it is possible to release less stable snow slabs and snow drifts of smaller dimensions, especially after large additional loads. At lower and middle altitudes spontaneous small avalanches and sluffs of wet snow may occur."
