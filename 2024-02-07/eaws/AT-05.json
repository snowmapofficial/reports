In danger zones which have not yet discharged on steep grassy slopes in all aspects, glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night, medium releases possible, on sunny slopes up to 2600 m. Avoid zones below glide cracks. \r\nOn high altitude shady slopes (above 2200 m) isolated weak layers in the snowpack can be problematic, triggerable mostly near ridges, behind discontinuities and in transitions from shallow to deeper snow on steep shady slopes, sometimes reaching large size. Slab avalanches from snowdrifts remain small, occasionally medium-sized. Caution of falling.",
