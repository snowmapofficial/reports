        "Comment": "There will be little change to the current snow conditions during Thursday. Slips or trips potentially serious due to short run outs onto rocks.",

        "SnowStability": "The remaining older snow cover will be firm and often very icy in places. Greatest amounts will be found above 900 metres in North to East facing corries and on higher plateau areas.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry and cold conditions will affect the area overnight and through Thursday. Moderate to fresh Easterly winds in the morning will strengthen through the day becoming strong occasionally gale by evening. The freezing level will be around 200 to 300 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The older snowpack will remain firm and icy in exposed locations with good general stability. Some redistribution of more recent snow will occur as the winds move into the East, localised areas of unstable windslab may form around the tops of summit gullies and on steep scarp slopes and corrie rims with a mainly South-West to Northerly aspect.

This will results in shallow and generally avoidable pockets of windslab at the tops of slopes and gullies on various aspects above 1000 metres. The older snowpack will remain very hard, icy and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Fresh deposits of windslab have accumulated on North to East aspects above 1000 metres, particularly at the top of slopes and gullies. Although these areas are not extensive or deep they are not well bonded. A recent small natural avalanche was observed on an Easterly aspects at an altitude of 1200 metres. Fresh cornices, although not large, are unstable.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
