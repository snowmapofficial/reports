The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in west to north to east facing aspects. Avalanches can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. As a consequence of warming loose snow avalanches are to be expected, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in very isolated cases in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, especially in the north. The avalanche prone locations are rare. Avalanches can reach medium size.",
