Above 2200 m fresh snowdrift accumulations from Thursday and Friday, esp. on N/E/S facing slopes are prone to triggering. Avalanches can be triggered by 1 person in many places and reach medium size. Danger zones increase with ascending altitude.\r\nAbove 2500 m, weak layers in the old snowpack can be triggered. Danger zones esp. on shady very steep slopes. Transitions from shallow to deeper snow are unfavourable. Releases usually require large additional loading but can fracture down to deeper layers and then grow to large size.\r\nBelow 2200 m the gliding snow activity persists. Danger zones occur in all aspects. Glide-snow avalanches can release on steep grassy slopes and smooth rocky ground at any time of day and reach medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",
