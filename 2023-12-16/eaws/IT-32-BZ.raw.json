Caution is to be exercised in particular above approximately 2200 m, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Avalanches can be released easily and reach medium size. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming loose snow avalanches are to be expected, but they will be mostly small. In addition there is a danger of gliding avalanches. This applies on steep slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example.
