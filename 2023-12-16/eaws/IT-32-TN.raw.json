In some cases avalanches are medium-sized and can be released even by a single winter sport participant. As a consequence of warming, the likelihood of moist loose snow avalanches being released will increase a little in particular on very steep sunny slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in very isolated cases by individual winter sport participants in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes in particular above approximately 2400 m."
