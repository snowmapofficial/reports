      "comment" : "The new snow and wind slabs of the last few days are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: <br/> The snowpack will be in most cases well bonded. As a consequence of low temperatures and low relative humidity a crust will form on the surface during the course of the night. The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. Below the tree line only a little snow is now lying."
