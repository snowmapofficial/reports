        "comment": "The new snow of Wednesday represents the main danger. This snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above the tree line. The new snow can be released by a single winter sport participant in all aspects above the tree line. Over a wide area 40 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1500 m. In particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation and on steep slopes occasionally large loose snow avalanches are possible as a consequence of the new snow. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind, wind slabs will form in the course of the day especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as above approximately 2500 m.",

The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on soft layers in particular on northwest to north to northeast facing aspects above approximately 2500 m. The fresh wind slabs are to be assessed with care and prudence. In particular slopes adjacent to ridgelines are especially precarious. The snowpack will become unstable over a wide area."
