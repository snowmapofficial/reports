        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs of the weekend are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized and can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. They are in some cases deep and can be released easily at their margins. <br/> <br/> In addition from midday on east, south and west facing slopes, some small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection.",
        "highlights": "Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution and restraint. Wet and gliding avalanches from early morning."
