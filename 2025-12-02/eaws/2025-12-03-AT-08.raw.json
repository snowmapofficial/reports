In addition, small-sized snowdrift accumulations occur in ridgeline terrain and behind protruberances in the landscape at increasing frequency with ascending altitude, these drifts are prone to triggering. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. Especially on steep grass-covered slopes, small-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible. Be careful beneath glide cracks."

With increasing altitude, particularly in ridgeline and pass zones, as well as behind protruberances in the landscape, small freshly-generated snowdrift accumulations occur. At high altitudes, especially on shady slopes, there are faceted intermediate layers inside the snowpack. These can be triggered in some places. There is still inadequate information available from off-piste terrain to the Avalanche Warning Service."
