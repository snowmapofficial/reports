The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2400 m. Avalanches can reach medium size. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can also be released in near-ground layers, in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Some snow fell in the last two days in some localities. In all regions a little snow is lying. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. <br/> The somewhat older wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the old snowpack in shady places that are protected from the wind. <br/> The autumnal weather conditions gave rise to moistening of the snowpack at intermediate altitudes."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Thursday: The avalanche danger will persist.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-03T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-04T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-03"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":["DP1","DP6"]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["W","NE","N","E","NW"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["W","NE","N","E","NW"]}],"bulletinID":"444a9663-e434-4a36-afc6-1e3f34526a78","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern Adamello","regionID":"IT-32-TN-02"},{"name":"Primiero - Pale di S.
