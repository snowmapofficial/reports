Weak layers in the old snowpack are difficult to recognise.","comment":"As a consequence of the new snow more frequent dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected. These can in many cases be released very easily or triggered naturally. The avalanches are rather small. In particular gullies and bowls are especially dangerous. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in some places in particular on very steep shady slopes. They are barely recognisable. Stability tests and field observations indicate the existence of a weak snowack. In isolated cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until midday above approximately 1500 m. The new snow will be deposited on soft layers in particular on wind-protected shady slopes. This snow will become increasingly prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> The fresh snow of recent weeks and local wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in some places in particular on wind-protected north and east facing slopes. Faceted weak layers exist in the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Thursday: Early and late morning: Temporary decrease in danger of dry avalanches as the snowfall eases.
