In the sectors from west to north to east, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by even a small additional load. Avalanches can break through to deeper weak layers and become medium sized if the snow is thick enough.\nIn west to north to east exposures above around 2200 m, small slab avalanches can also be triggered in fresh drift snow. The few danger spots are mainly close to the crest. Below 2800 m, mostly small sliding snow avalanches can occur spontaneously.",
