        "SnowDistribution": "Variable underfoot with icy patches, shallow snow on ice and deep drifts of new windslab. Cloudy on the tops, with some brighter spells. Winds 35-45 mph.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds are expected to be gale force generally Southerly. It will be dry overnight, with showers starting just before dawn continuing through the day, though more showery. These will fall as snow mainly above about 850 metres. The freezing level will be around 900 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Moderately bonded windslab will be present in wind sheltered locations. Greatest accumulations will lie on North-West through North to East aspects above 950 metres. Cornices will be present above these aspects. On other aspects and at lower elevations the snowpack will be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After overnight precipitation, which fell as snow above 850 metres, there were some light showers during the day. Winds were gale force, mainly South-Westerly. The freezing level was around 900 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab has been deposited in wind sheltered locations, mainly on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. Drifting continued through the day. Fragile cornices are building above these aspects. On other aspects and at lower elevations the snowpack is generally stable. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "Travel in the hills becoming slightly easier as the snowpack continues to firm up.  Areas of breakable crust still present, but not as widespread as previous days.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry forecast period with some afternoon showers expected, falling as snow above 900 metres.  A steady Southerly wind, storm force overnight before easing slightly during the day.  The freezing level will hover around 900 metres rising slightly through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Moderately bonded windslab will persist on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.  Areas most affected will be steep wind shelters locations such as gully tops, coire rims and crag aprons.  The old snowpack continues to consolidate and will remain stable throughout.  Little snow remains below 800 metres.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Greatest accumulations were found on steep wind sheltered locations such as crag aprons, coire rims, gully tops.  The existing snowpack continues to consolidate and has generally good stability throughout.   The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
