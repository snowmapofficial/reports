There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can\u00b4t be ruled out with high additional load. In few places with thin fresh snowdrift deposits slab avalanches are also possible. In sunny rocky terrain wet  loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can\u00b4t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces.",

In places thin snowdrift deposits have formed which are poorly bonded with the old snow cover. Weak layers are only found in shady slopes in the highest altitudes within the old snow cover (Graupel, soft crystals). The old snow cover is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."

In the afternoon it will be sunny. Increasing winds, brisk to strong velocities in the mountains with possible gusts.Temperatures get milder with temperatures at 2.000 m are between -3 and 0 degrees, at 1.500 m between +1 and +3 degrees."
