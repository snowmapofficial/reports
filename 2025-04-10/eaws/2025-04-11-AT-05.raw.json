On very steep north-facing slopes above 2400m and on W/E-facing slopes above 2600m, avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and in isolated cases grow to large size. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small moist loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day. Due to strong-velocity northerly winds, small danger zones will be generated through fresh snowdrift patches which can be prone to triggering on very steep north-facing slopes (most are easy to recognize). From very steep grass-covered slopes below 2600m, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally."

In high-alpine regions, thin snowdrifts are being generated on E/S-facing slopes. On shady slopes below 2200m and on sunny slopes, the old snowpack is mostly moist. On very steep, little structure terrain surfaces, the entire snowpack oftens glides downhill."
