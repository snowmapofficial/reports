      "comment" : "In the High, Western and Western part of the Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger - 2nd degree. During Friday we expect a warm front to pass through in the afternoon, bringing gradual warming, precipitation and very strong winds. The wind will blow the loose snow to the leeward sides of the mountains (SE, SW, and SW) where it will deposit it in slabs of varying thickness and hardness. Their distribution will be very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Mostly under saddles, rock walls and in leeward troughs, where the snow will be deposited to a thickness of more than 50 cm. Avalanche release will be possible on very steep to extremely steep slopes, especially at higher additional loads.",
      "highlights" : "Long lasting very strong winds - watch out for wind-blown snow on leeward sides."
