As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of wet and gliding avalanches to level 2 (moderate). All aspects: These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally. This applies in particular in the regions with a lot of snow at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars."

Shady slopes high altitudes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of surface hoar. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours should be started and concluded early. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks."
