Danger zones occur mostly on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry skiing tours demand a very conscious route selection. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, fresh snowdrifts require caution. During the course of the day, avalanche danger increases to Danger Level 2. Especialy on sun-basked steep slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches are possible. Backcountry tours should be launched early, and brought to an end early in the day."

Isolated triggerings are possible in extremely steep terrain by large additional loading. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, fresh snowdrift accumulations require caution. Due to daytime warming and solar radiation, the snowpack forfeits its firmness and danger rises to Danger Level 2, moderate. Esp. on sun-basked steep slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches are possible. Backcountry tours should be launched early and brought to a close early in the day."
