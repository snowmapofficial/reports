        "comment": "Winter sports enthusiasts can often trigger small-to-medium avalanches in the old snow. Danger zones occur mostly on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry skiing tours demand a very conscious route selection. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, fresh snowdrifts require caution. During the course of the day, avalanche danger increases to Danger Level 2. Especialy on sun-basked steep slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches are possible. Backcountry tours should be launched early, and brought to an end early in the day.",
