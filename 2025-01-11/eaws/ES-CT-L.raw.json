      "comment" : "The fresh snow and in particular the sometimes deep wind slabs can be released easily, or, in isolated cases naturally in all aspects. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2000 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> Extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and great restraint are required. Careful route selection and spacing between individuals are recommended."

      "comment" : "Over a wide area 10 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen above approximately 1800 m. Up to 15 cm of snow will fall in the next few hours above approximately 1800 m. Near the border with Ribagor√ßa and Pallars: As a consequence of the strong to storm force northwesterly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. <br/> <br/> Shady slopes: The upper section of the snowpack is unfavourably layered and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
