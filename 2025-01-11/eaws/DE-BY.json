        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2000m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main problem: snowdrift accumulations. These can trigger a medium-sized avalanche by one sole skier/snowboarder. Avalanche prone locations occur in steep ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gulles and bowls. The snowdrift accumulations are easily recognized for the practiced eye. At lower altitudes the slab avalanche releases are small, larger higher up. Possibility of medium-sized glide-snow avalanches on steep smooth grass-covered slopes in all aspects, releases mostly small, but occasionally medium-sized.",
