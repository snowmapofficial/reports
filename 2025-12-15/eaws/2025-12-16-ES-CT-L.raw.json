Gliding avalanches are still possible.","comment":"High altitudes and the high Alpine regions: The fresh wind slabs are easy to recognise and prone to triggering. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are possible. Slopes adjacent to ridgelines are especially dangerous. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> As the penetration by moisture increases more small gliding avalanches are possible below approximately 2300 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"5 to 10 cm of snow, but less in some localities, has fallen above approximately 2000 m. The wind was strong to storm force in some regions. The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. The fresh wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. <br/> <br/> Low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities.
