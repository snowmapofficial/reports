At high altitudes, small slab avalanches can occasionally be triggered in very steep terrain in northern exposures with high additional loads.\n  \nIn addition, individual, small sliding snow avalanches can be triggered on extremely steep sunny slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged."

Crystals with an angular structure have formed under the snow cover, especially on the shaded side. Above 2000 m, the upper half metre of the snow cover on the shaded side has retained some snow-covered surface frost. However, snowpack tests show that large-scale fracture propagation is no longer to be expected. The base of the snowpack is partly wet. There is little snow, on the south side the ground is covered well into the middle layers."
