        "comment": "The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs represent the main danger. This applies in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> In all aspects large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and strong wind. The new snow and wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in all aspects. In addition the barely recognisable wind slabs should be taken into account. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of loose snow slides being released will increase gradually in particular on steep sunny slopes. Gliding avalanches can also occur.",
        "highlights": "A lot of snow has fallen in some regions. <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche danger is higher."
