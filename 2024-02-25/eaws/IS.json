An extended column test in Bl\u00e1fj\u00f6ll 22nd of feb. gave a fracture that propagated at medium load on a slush layer between stiffer slabs. In these conditions, large avalanches are not expected but gullies and depressions that have gathered much new snow can be dangerous. Thawing weather on Monday will temporarily compromise stability in the snowpack."
