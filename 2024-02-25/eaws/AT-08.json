        "comment": "Fresh and older snowdrifts are the main danger, often blanketed and hard to recognize. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain,  behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and increase with ascending altitude. A small-to-medium slab avalanche or loose-snow avalanche can be triggered by 1 person (in high-alpine terrain larger). Activities in backcountry demand experience in outlying terrain and the ability to assess avalanche dangers on-site. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger below 2600 m at any time of day or night and reach large size. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
