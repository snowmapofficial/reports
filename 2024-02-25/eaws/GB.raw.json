        "Summary": "LO for 26/2. Areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain on N to E aspects about 900m. Large cornices remain. Moderate hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Soft snow above 500m - some exposed ridges scoured.  Good visibility.  Winds approx 10mph or less.",
        "Comment": "Forecast to turn a bit less settled from Tuesday onwards.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Another dry day is expected. The freezing level will be around 600 metres. Northerly winds will strengthen overnight before easing through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Additionally, South-East and South aspects above this level may be affected by the redistribution of the softer surface layers of the snowpack. Some large and unstable cornices will remain. Below 900 metres stability will be better.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It was a dry and settled day with light Easterly winds. After an overnight frost the freezing level rose to around 600 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The cold snowpack is very slowly consolidating in the settled conditions. However, some instabilities remain in the windslab, which is found on mainly North to East aspects above 900 metres. Some large and threatening cornices are to be found above these aspects.

        "SnowStability": "Cold conditions will maintain some localised instabilities in recent windslab deposits. In particular steep summit gullies and coire rims on North to East aspects, mainly above 900 metres. Fragile cornices will be present above these aspects. Some limited redistribution onto Southerly aspects overnight, however any new deposits here are expected to be very shallow. Elsewhere there will be a cover of soft, stable snow.

Shallow accumulations of windslab will start to form in wind sheltered locations on Southerly aspects above 900 metres.
