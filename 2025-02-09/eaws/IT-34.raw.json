Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants in particular above approximately 1900 m. Avalanches can penetrate even deep layers. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow barely recognisable for beginners."

This applies in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 1900 m. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust."
