The fresh snow and local wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. Winter sport participants can release avalanches in some places, including medium-sized ones. Avalanches can in isolated cases penetrate deep layers and reach quite a large size. Weak layers in the old snowpack are difficult to recognise. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on steep west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line."
