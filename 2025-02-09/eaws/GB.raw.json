A hard frost in the glen this morning soon cleared in sun affected areas. Remaining snow patches are very firm, particularly in the shade with serious and consequential runouts. More of the same expected tomorrow as the high pressure continues.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Fresh Easterly winds overnight, increasing to very strong by mid-morning. A clear, dry and sunny day is forecast. A fluctuating freezing level reflecting the influence of high pressure. However, it is expected that the ground will remain frozen above 400 meters.",

However, these areas are not particularly extensive. On other aspects, and at lower altitudes, stability is generally good. A few sections of unstable cornice remain.

Greatest accumulation of snow can be found above 1000 metres, with the high North and East facing coires retaining most cover.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Within the snowpack, some residual instabilities still exist mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres. These are localised in nature and are mainly confined to gully tops and coire rims.

Likely forecast: Scattered snow showers possibly developing on Monday night, continuing maybe into Tuesday morning but accumulations are expected to be very light. Becoming dry through Tuesday afternoon and remaining dry into Wednesday. Freezing level in the region of 500 to 700 metres.",

Remaining dry and quite cool, an early morning frost in the glens is likely. The winds will be Easterly throughout, fresh at first strengthening to strong through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected. Windslab will persist mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Weaknesses in this windslab will remain generally supported by a surface crust. Steep gully exits and coire rims will be most affected. Some isolated instabilities on North-West aspects are also possible. Fragile cornices will be present above these aspects. In other locations the snowpack will be generally shallow with better stability. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Today was almost an identical repeat of yesterday; starting with a frost in the glens and an inversion in the morning over some summits which cleared as the day progressed. Winds were Easterly with a cold bite to them. The freezing level was around 600 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Cool overnight conditions have maintained the existing localised windslab deposits, these are mainly on North to East aspects above 850 metres. Instabilities in this windslab are bridged by a surface crust in most places. Some fragile cornices are present above similar aspects. Snow cover on other aspects is generally shallow and stability is good. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
