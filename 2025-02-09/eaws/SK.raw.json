      "comment" : "During Monday, the weather in the Slovak mountains will be influenced by high pressure, we expect a gradual decrease in cloud cover, which will not bring a significant change in the avalanche situation. With the change in temperatures over the last two weeks, the snow cover has settled and frozen to hard firn or crust. Avalanche release is possible only very locally, sporadically on the northern slopes of the highest elevations, and on steep and very steep slopes. On south-facing slopes, the snowpack surface will soften during the day, but not to an extent increasing the avalanche hazard. The danger is not from burial, but rather from small avalanches on exposed terrain or rock formations in the path of an avalanche.",
      "highlights" : "Predominantly favourable avalanche situation."

      "comment" : "Snow cover is well below average for the time of year. Continuous snow cover is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above 1500 m). The absence of any precipitation and the alternation of temperatures has caused it to melt and freeze. Its surface is a frozen layer of firn, in some cases even ice. As a result of Monday's clear weather, the surface of the snow cover is expected to melt gradually on the southern slopes. Care should be taken when moving in the mountains to avoid slipping, the current conditions do not tolerate any mistakes."
