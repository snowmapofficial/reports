        "comment": "Above approximately 1900 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain individual slab avalanches are possible. These can be released by large loads, but they will be small in most cases. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust.",
        "highlights": "Small avalanches are possible in isolated cases. In particular, however, the no longer entirely fresh wind slabs should be taken into account."
