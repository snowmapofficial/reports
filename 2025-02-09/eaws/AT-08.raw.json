      "comment" : "In some places avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier, generate small-to-medium sized releases, mostly above 2200m in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. Freshly generated snowdrift accumjlations are prone to triggering, require attentiveness in steep terrain. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are still possible. Caution urged below glide cracks."

Elsewhere a wind crust is evident which is often capable of bearing loads, on sunny slopes there is a melt-crust. Small snowdrift accumulations are evident. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten/soften on steep sunny slopes. Small-area fresh snowdrifts have been generated."

At high altitudes, small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are frequently prone to triggering. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall need due consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is difficult to estimate. Caution urged below glide-cracks."
