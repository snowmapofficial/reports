Small-to-medium slab avalanches can be triggered even by the weight of one single skier. Above 2400m, isolated avalanches can trigger in the old snow and grow to medium size. Below the trereline, avalanche danger is low."

The fresh snow will be increasely poorly bonded with the old snowpack surface with ascending altitude. In places in high-altitude shady spots and where the snow is shallow, weak faceted layers are evident in the snowpack. All in all, the snowpack is highly varied: ridges are often windblown, gullies and bowls are filled to the brim with snow."
