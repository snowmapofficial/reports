Elsewhere the snowpack is well bonded up to high altitudes. On south-facing slopes the snowpack is moist-to-wet, only on north-facing slopes are the uppermost layers still dry, thus, they can be transported by the southerly foehn winds, deposited as thin, fresh snowdrift accumulations, poorly bonded with dry-snow surfaces, better bonded with the moist surfaces at intermediate altitudes. On shady slopes, still reserves of cold up to summit levels."
