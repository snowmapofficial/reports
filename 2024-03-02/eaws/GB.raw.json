Isolated soft windslab deposits contain weaknesses and are located in steep wind sheltered places which overlie the older firm snowpack e.g. around coire rims and multi aspect gully tops. Elsewhere a thin covering of fresh snow is present above 600 metres. Limited cornice development was noted above Southerly aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Generally an overcast day, cloudy over the higher summits with light Northerly winds. Midday summit temperature was around minus 2.5 degrees celsius with freezing level about 550 metres. Brighter and drier conditions arrived in the afternoon.",

Deeper accumulations on mostly North to Easterly aspects above 800 metres are soft but are consolidating and are generally stable.
