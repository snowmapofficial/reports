Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow, as well as at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, rather small wind slabs will form, especially on near-ridge shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

These can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> In some regions up to 5 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall. <br/> As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface during the last few days, especially on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m. <br/> The snowpack will be soft on wind-protected shady slopes. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
