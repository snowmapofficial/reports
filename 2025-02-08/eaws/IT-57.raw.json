      "comment" : "Above approximately 1900 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain individual slab avalanches are possible. These can be released by large loads, but they will be small in most cases. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust."

Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from the middle of the day to increasing moistening of the old snowpack in some cases in particular at intermediate and high altitudes."
