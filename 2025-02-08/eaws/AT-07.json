Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow, as well as at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, rather small wind slabs will form, especially on near-ridge shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions.
