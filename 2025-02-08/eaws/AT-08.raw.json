Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. Freshly generated snowdrift accumjlations are prone to triggering, require attentiveness in steep terrain. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are still possible. Caution urged below glide cracks."

Elsewhere a wind crust is evident which is often capable of bearing loads, on sunny slopes there is a melt-crust. Small snowdrift accumulations are evident. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten on steep sunny slopes."

On very steep grass-covered slopes, small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally."
