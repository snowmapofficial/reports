Danger zones occur mostly in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, a on very steep shady slopes above 1900m.  Attention must be given to the dangers of being swept along and forced to take a fall."

In the lower part of the snowpack there are faceted expansively metamorphosed crystals evident. Sunny slopes: snowpack largely stable, with a crust on the surface."
