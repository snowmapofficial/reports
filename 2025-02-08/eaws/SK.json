        "comment": "On Sunday, we expect cloudy weather and light winds, which will not bring a significant change in the avalanche situation in the Slovak mountains. Due to the change in temperatures over the last two weeks, the snow cover has settled and frozen into a hard firn or crust. Avalanches can only be released very locally, rarely on the northern slopes of the highest elevations, on steep and very steep slopes. The danger is not being buried, but rather being swept away by a small avalanche into exposed terrain, or rock formations sticking out in the avalanche path.",
        "highlights": "Predominantly favourable avalanche situation."

        "comment": "Snow cover is well below average for the time of year. Continuous snow cover is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above 1500 m). The absence of any precipitation and the alternation of temperatures has caused it to melt and freeze. Its surface is a frozen layer of firn, in some cases even ice. Due to the expected cloud cover, the snow cover is not expected to melt during the day. Care should be taken when moving in the mountains to avoid slipping, the current conditions do not tolerate any mistakes."
