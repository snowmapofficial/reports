        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2400m is moderate. Slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading in some places, caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow. On very steep north-facing slopes above 2400m and on W/E-facing slopes above 2600m, avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and in isolated cases grow to large size. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small moist loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day. Due to strong-velocity northerly winds, small danger zones will be generated through fresh snowdrift patches which can be prone to triggering on very steep north-facing slopes (most are easy to recognize). From very steep grass-covered slopes below 2600m, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally.",
