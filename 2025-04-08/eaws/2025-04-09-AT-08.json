        "comment": "Winter sports enthusiasts can trigger small-to-medium-sized avalanches in the old snow. Danger zones occur on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes which are difficult to recognize, they increase with ascending altitude. Backcountry tours require an well-considered route selection. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, small fresh snowdrifts require caution. Avalanche danger increases during the course of the day. Particularly in intensively sun-bathed steep terrain, increasingly also on shady slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalances remains difficult to assess.",

Due to daytime rise in temperatures and solar radiation, the snowpack weakens as the day unfolds."
