On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, moist slab avalanches can in some places be triggered by human activity.</p><p>Only a thin melt-freeze crust will form during the night to Wednesday,  and as daytime temperatures rise in the sunshine this will soften rapidly over the course of the day, with the risk of wet and gliding avalanches increasing right from the morning onwards.</p>"

In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack, and a few avalanches were triggered in the old snowpack last weekend, particularly from the Davos region via the Engadine to Val M\u00fcstair.</p><p>The snow is becoming increasingly moist even higher up and on shady slopes. On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, moist slab avalanches can in some places be triggered by human activity.</p><p>Only a thin melt-freeze crust will form during the night to Wednesday,  and as daytime temperatures rise in the sunshine this will soften rapidly over the course of the day, with the risk of wet and gliding avalanches increasing right from the morning onwards.</p>"
