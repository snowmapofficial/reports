      "comment" : "The area of the Eastern Alps is located between a pronounced high-pressure system in the west and a low-pressure system in the east. A strong northern high stream causes a relatively cold and windy mountain weather. Monday night is partially cloudy. Tuesday morning will be dominated by clouds and some unproductive snow showers in Kalkalpen. In the afternoon it starts to clear up and it will be sunny in the evening. The northern winds remains brisk to strong especially in the eastern regions. Temperatures at 2.000 m are between -8 and -4 degrees, at 1.500 m between -4 and +1 degrees."

      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is low. Danger spots are only in some places in shady steep areas in high altitudes. There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can´t be ruled out. In few places fresh snowdrift deposits which formed with the northerly winds are prone to triggering, the risk of falling outweighs the risk of burial. In sunny rocky terrain loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can´t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snow cover mostly settled and stable. In most places surface haare has formed and sometimes the surfaces are influenced by the winds. In places thin snowdrift deposits have formed which are poorly bonded with the old snow cover. Weak layers are only found in shady slopes in the highest altitudes within the old snow cover (Graupel, soft crystals). The old snow cover is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."
