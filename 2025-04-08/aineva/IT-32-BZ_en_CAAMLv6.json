These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2800 m. Avalanches can in some cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day, the likelihood of moist loose snow avalanches being released will increase a little. <br/> <br/> The mostly small wind slabs of the last few days are in individual cases still prone to triggering on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions.
