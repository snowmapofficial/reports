On very steep slopes with smooth ground and grass-covered terrain and forest clearances, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night. Releases mostly medium size. Avoid zones beneath glide cracks.\r\nOn N/E/SE facing slopes small snowdrift accumulations are forming during the day which can be triggered by 1 skier. Slab avalanche releases are usually small, the risks of falling need consideration. In isolated cases avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack and grow to large size.\r\nIn very steep terrain below 1300 m, small wet-snow slides are possible.",
