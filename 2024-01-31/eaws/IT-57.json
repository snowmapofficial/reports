        "comment": "As a consequence of warming individual mostly small snow slides and avalanches are possible above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as on very steep sunny slopes. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust.",
        "highlights": "Wet snow represents the main danger."

        "comment": "The old snowpack remains subject to considerable local variations. At intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In high Alpine regions a little snow is lying. In gullies and bowls the wind slabs are larger. These are to be found especially at high altitude. The weather conditions will give rise to moistening of the snowpack also at high altitude."
