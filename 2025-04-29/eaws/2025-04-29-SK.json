        "comment": "In the high altitudes of the High Tatras (above 2000 m above sea level) there is a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. Due to warm conditions, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes, where a larger amount of snow is concentrated, are dangerous. Here it is possible to release an avalanche, especially with a large additional load. Only small avalanches or avalanches can be expected. Avalanches are no longer expected in other mountain ranges."

Continuous snow cover is found from the 1900-2000 m above sea level (depending on orientation), with the most of it in terrain depressions, in troughs and at the ends of the Tatra valleys. In case of a fall on the snow fields there is a risk of hitting the rocks."
