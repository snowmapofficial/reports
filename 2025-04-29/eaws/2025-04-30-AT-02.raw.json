Below 3000m mostly small releases are possible, esp. on very steep slopes and at the foot of rock walls. Hohe Tauern: snowdrift accumulations are hardly prone to triggering. Isolated danger zones occur on shady slopes in high-alpine zones."

The snowpack is thoroughly wet, esp. on shady slopes below 2800m and on sunny slopes below 3200m. In all regions there is too little snow on the ground. In all regions, too little snow on the ground. Hohe Tauern: below 2200m hardly any snow. Carnic Alps: below 1800m, hardly any snow on the ground."
