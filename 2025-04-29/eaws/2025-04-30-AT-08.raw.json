      "comment" : "The daily Avalanche Bulletins are no longer being published. Due to current weather conditions, the situation can be assessed as follows: in the early morning and later hours, generally favorable conditions with low avalanche danger prevail. During the course of the day, small-to-medium sized wet-snow avalanches, as well as ongoing small glide-snow avalanches, continue to be possible in starting zones which have not yet discharged. Backcountry ski tours should be launched early and brought to an end early in the day. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, small snowdrift accumulations can be prone to triggering from place to place. In high-alpine zones, in addition, seldom-tracked shady slopes in touring terrain require cautious route selection."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The old snowpack is thoroughly wet up to high altitudes. During nights of clear skies, a crust forms on the snowpack surface which is capable of bearing loads, but softens up during the morning. In high-alpine ridgeline terrain, local small-area snowdrift accumulations are evident. In seldom-tracked terrain on shady steep slopes in high-alpine zones, there are unfavorable intermediate layers inside the snowpack. However, there have been no avalanches reported over the last few days."
