These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Some occasionally large avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> In places that are protected from the wind dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. These can be released easily. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for great caution and restraint."

The northwesterly wind will transport the fresh and old snow significantly. The wind will be strong to storm force especially at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. <br/> <br/> The conditions are treacherous for backcountry touring."
