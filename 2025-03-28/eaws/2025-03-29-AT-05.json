Above 2200m on north-facing slopes weak layers of faceted crystals are found in the lowermost part of the snowpack. Above 2400m on W/S/E facing slopes there are faceted crystals between crusts. Inside the snowdrifts, in addition, trigger-sensitive layers can form rapidly. Below 2000m the snowpack will forfeit its firmness on Friday night due to rainfall and water seepage."
