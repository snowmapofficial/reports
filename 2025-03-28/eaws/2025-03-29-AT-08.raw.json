Isolated winter sports enthusiasts in these zones can trigger small slab avalanches. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches persists. At intermediate altitudes the old snowpack is thoroughly wet and mostly small wet-snow avalanches are possible."

The fresh fallen snow will be transported during the course of the day by intensifying northerly winds. At high altitudes the fresh snow and drifts will be deposited atop soft layers particularly on shady slopes and is prone to triggering. The snowpack is moist up to high altitudes and weakened by rainfall. Gliding movements are still possible over smooth ground."
