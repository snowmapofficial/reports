In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into high Alpine regions, as well as on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2000 to 2200 m. The surface of the snowpack only remains loose in places on steep north-facing slopes above approximately 2500 m.</p>"
