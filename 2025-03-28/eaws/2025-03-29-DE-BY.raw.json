New fallen snow is problematic and can trigger spontaneously as loose snow avalanches in steep terrain in all aspects. For the time being avalanches will remain mostly small. In addition, a single person can release a small slab avalanche. This is applies in particular to steep high altitude slopes adjacent to ridgelines.

At higher altitudes the fresh snow is deposited atop soft snow layers, especially on the shady side. Bonding of new snow and old snowpack is partly poor, making it prone to triggering. On exposed ridges, the new fallen snow will be bonded slab-like by northerly winds. However, winds are too weak to transport larger quantities. Near the ground, the snowpack is wet and rough-grained."

The main problem is new snow which can trigger spontaneously as loose snow avalanches in steep terrain in all aspects. Releases are small. In addition, a single person can release a small slab avalanche. This is applies in particular to steep high altitude slopes adjacent to ridgelines. Currently, the number of avalanche prone locations is still low, but will increase somewhat as the day progresses. Isolated glide snow avalanches can trigger on steep grass-covered slopes that have not yet discharged. Releases, if any, are most likely in the Allgäu and are mostly small."
