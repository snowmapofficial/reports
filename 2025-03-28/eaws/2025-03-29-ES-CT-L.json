        "comment": "Friday: As a consequence of a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, precarious wind slabs formed in the course of the day at high altitude. <br/> Saturday: As a consequence of new snow and strong wind the wind slabs will increase in size. These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Some occasionally large avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> In places that are protected from the wind dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. These can be released easily. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for great caution and restraint.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. The wind will be strong to storm force."
