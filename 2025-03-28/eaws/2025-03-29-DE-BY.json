On exposed ridges, the new fallen snow will be bonded slab-like by northerly winds. However, winds are too weak to transport larger quantities.

The main problem is new snow which can trigger spontaneously as loose snow avalanches in steep terrain in all aspects. Releases are small. In addition, a single person can release a small slab avalanche. This is applies in particular to steep high altitude slopes adjacent to ridgelines. Currently, the number of avalanche prone locations is still low, but will increase somewhat as the day progresses. Isolated glide snow avalanches can trigger on steep grass-covered slopes that have not yet discharged. Releases, if any, are most likely in the Allg\u00e4u and are mostly small.",
