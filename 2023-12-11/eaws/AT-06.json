The last trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations fom Sunday morning occur esp. on shady slopes above 1900 m. Due to poor sibitility the danger zones are difficult to recognize. Main danger: wet loose-snow avalanches. Danger zones extend from high to low altitudes on hillsides (snowslides). Also glide-snow avalanches are a threat, thus, avoid zones below glide cracks.",

        "comment": "The snowfall from Sunday to Monday at high altitudes was minor (about 20 cm between Dachstein and Hochschwab, 10 cm in the southern mountain ranges) but rainfall up to 1500 m. The fresh snow is bonding poorly with the melt-freeze encrusted old snowpack, stormy westerly winds transported it mostly to NE/SE facing slopes. On Monday the snowpack forfeited much of its firmness due to rain and higher temperatures, this process will continue on Tuesday. Only on high altitude shady slopes will the snowpack have greater inner reserves of cold, therefore remain brittle and prone to triggering for longer."

Danger zones esp. on NE/S facing slopes, esp. behind protruberances and at entries into gullies and bowls where snowdrift accumulations can trigger slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading (1 person).
