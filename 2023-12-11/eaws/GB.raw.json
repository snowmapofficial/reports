        "Summary": "NC for 12.12. Poorly bonded windslab building SW,W and NW aspects above 850 metres. Cornices building. Avalanche Hazard Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack below 850 metres, consolidating, becoming firmer above. No visibility throughout the day above 700 metres. Winds approx 10-20 mph fresh, cooling etc.",
        "Comment": "Snow amounts are uncertain, the greatest quantities are expected in the South and East of the area.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "After a dry night precipitation is expected throughout the day, this falling as light snow above 800 metres. Winds will be strong East-South-Easterly overnight, backing to become very strong from the East by mid morning. The freezing level will be around 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh poorly bonded windslab will be deposited from the start of the day, mostly on South-West though West to North-West aspects above 850 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims, convexities and gully tops will be affected. Slopes exposed to wind will be scoured, while at lower elevations snow patches will remain moist and stable. Cornices will build from early in the day. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A day of poor visibility with very light rain falling as a dusting of snow above 950 metres. The freezing level was around 1000 metres. Winds were fresh and from the East.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is moist and consolidated in most locations, with a widespread soft crust. Stability was observed to be good, as the snow pack continues to consolidate in the fluctuating temperatures. Cornices were observed above Northerly aspects around coire rims. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
