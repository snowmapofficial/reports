        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects, especially in areas close to the tree line and above the tree line. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The fresh wind slabs can especially at their margins be released very easily. Avalanches can also penetrate deep layers and reach medium size. <br/> The conditions are precarious for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities outside marked and open pistes.",
        "highlights": "The backcountry and freeriding conditions are mostly favourable."

        "comment": "In the regions of the north exposed to the foehn wind over a wide area 15 to 30 cm of snow has fallen above approximately 2000 m. The violent wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm indicating the danger. The fresh wind slabs are lying on soft layers at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted. The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations."
