The avalanches are small and can be released by a single winter sport participant. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate this situation. <br/> <br/> Moist snow slides are to be expected, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for caution."

The wind will be moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines especially at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. <br/> <br/> The fresh wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying."
