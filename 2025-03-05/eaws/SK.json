        "comment": "In the High, West and Low Tatras above the forest line a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) is declared. In general, the snow from the last snowfall period (Thursday-Saturday) has melted and a layer of crust or firn has formed on its surface on the southern exposures due to temperature changes. On the S facing slopes it is still possible to find places with dry untreated snow lying on a layer of ice or old hardened snow, between which there is a dangerous layer of square-grained snow. During Thursday, the weather in the mountains of Slovakia will be influenced by a pressure high, which will bring clear and very warm weather. On S-facing exposures, the snow cover will be progressively sun-soaked during the day. Avalanche release is expected mainly on steep to very steep terrain, especially with high additional loads. Stability is very difficult to assess on S slopes, the most dangerous places are those with visibly blown snow, and on S slopes it is important to note the waterlogged snow layer. During the day, spontaneous avalanches and avalanches of wet snow can also occur on the S slopes. Only small or medium avalanches are to be expected, but the problem is the transport and accumulation zone of the deposits, where, due to the low snow cover, there is often rock debris or exposed rock blocks.",
        "highlights": "The caution to the north is still a permanently weak layer. Wet snow in the south."
