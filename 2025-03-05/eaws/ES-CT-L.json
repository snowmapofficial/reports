        "comment": "As a consequence of southerly wind, sometimes avalanche prone wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at elevated altitudes. The avalanches are small and can be released by a single winter sport participant. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate this situation. <br/> <br/> Moist snow slides are to be expected, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for caution.",
