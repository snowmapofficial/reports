At night on sunny slopes and at lower altitudes, a melt-freeze crust forms, which then softens up during the daytime. The below-average old snowpack is well consolidated all in all. With rising temperatures and solar radiation, the snowpack is moistening down to intermediate altitudes, and as it becomes wetter, it becomes weaker."
