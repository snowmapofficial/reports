        "comment": "The weather will be very warm. The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from early morning to rapid softening of the snowpack over a wide area. <br/> In the late morning the likelihood of moist and wet avalanches being released will increase in particular on rocky sunny slopes below approximately 3600 m. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> In starting zones where no previous releases have taken place and at intermediate and high altitudes medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses as a consequence of solar radiation. These can also be released in near-ground layers. <br/> As a consequence of wind from northeasterly directions, mostly small wind slabs formed on Wednesday in some localities. These avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on near-ridge shady slopes above approximately 3200 m. They are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
        "highlights": "Significant warming: Backcountry tours and ascents to alpine cabins should be started and concluded early. Wet snow represents the main danger."
