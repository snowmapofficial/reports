        "Summary": "NC for 13.4: The snowpack will firm up through the afternoon and remain stable. Isolated windslab N to E aspects above 900m. Low Haz",
        "SnowDistribution": "Thawing snowpack throughout.   Good visibility, occasional cloud over the tops in the afternoon during light showers.   Winds approx 50 - 70 mph progress very difficult with potential to be taken off your feet during gusts.",
        "Comment": "As it turns cooler the snowpack will firm up, steep slopes will have serious run out potential into rocks below.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mainly dry before the arrival of light precipitation during the afternoon, this will fall as snow initially at summit levels then to above 800 metres as the freezing level falls to this level towards the end of the day. South-West to West-South-Westerly winds will be gale to storm force.",
        "SnowStability": "The old snowpack will begin to firm up during the afternoon and remain well bonded and stable throughout.  Isolated accumulations of windslab will develop on North to East aspects above 900 metres.  These  will be mainly shallow, avoidable and in wind sheltered locations.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A sunny morning followed by an afternoon of light showers falling as rain at all levels.  Winds were strong to gale force West-South-Westerly.  The freezing level remained above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack continues to thaw at all altitudes and is generally well bonded and stable throughout.  The snowpack is most widespread above 1000 metres around coire back walls on North-West through East to Southerly aspects and the plateau.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Some windslab developing late in the period above 1000m but not expected to be deep or extensive.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Some overnight rainfall at all levels then dry and cooler. Some sleety snowfall during the morning extending into the afternoon. Strong West-South-West winds.",
        "SnowStability": "The old exposed patchy snowpack will refreeze and be firm and well stabilised. New moist windslab will begin to form on steep very sheltered North to East aspects above 1000m. New accumulations not expected to be extensive and will be confined to the top of coire rims and gully tops. Some minor new cornice development over lee slopes but only very late in the period.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Patchy snow cover with little or no snow below 800m except on some North and East aspects. The snowpack is moist but well bonded in all locations. Surface conditions vary from firm to soft depending on altitude and aspect. Residual cornices hang over some very steep East facing coire rims, crags and gullies.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Much more wintry over the week-end with snow possibly falling down to 300 metres! Strong, even gale force winds.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will lower to around 700 metres during the morning. Showers falling as snow above 600 metres accompanied by strong to gale force South-Westerly winds.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing old moist snowpack will consolidate. New snow amounts are not expected to be significant mainly a light dusting, lying mostly on bare ground. Stability will generally remain good in most locations. Localised areas of shallow windslab will form in wind sheltered locations, mainly around the tops of summit gullies and steep scarp slopes with a North to Easterly aspect above 900 metres. These accumulations are not expected to be deep or extensive. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After a little overnight rain it was a dry morning, isolated rain showers started to fall at all levels around mid-day. The freezing level was well above the summits and winds were strong from a South-Westerly direction.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is moist at all elevations and has diminished a little further and is generally now quite patchy.

Isolated and generally shallow areas of unstable windslab will develop mainly on North to East aspects, above 1300 metres overnight and down to 900 metres during the day.
