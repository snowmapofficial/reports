Freshly generated snowdrift accumulations are triggerable in a few places by low additional loading, esp. on north-facing slopes above 2600m, in other aspects higher up. Avalanche releases are mostly small, in isolated cases medium-sized. In steep terrain which has not yet discharged, small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches can trigger naturally at any time of day or night, or else be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. Also isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible."

The thoroughly wet snowpack at low altitudes is regaining a certain firmness through the lower temperatures."
