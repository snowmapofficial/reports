Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information about the snowpack, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."

Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to rapid moistening of the snowpack. At low altitude no snow is lying."
