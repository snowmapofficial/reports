Avalanche prone locations occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts, In isolated cases, small glide-snow avalanches are also possible. Esp. in the Silvretta above 2600m by large additional loading, small-to-medium avalanches can be triggered in the old snow. Such danger zones occur in seldom-tracked, shady backcountry touring areas and are difficult to recognize."
