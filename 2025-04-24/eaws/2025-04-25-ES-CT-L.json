        "comment": "In all aspects mostly small moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information about the snowpack, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
        "highlights": "Wet snow represents the main danger. Especially in the valleys bordering the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and the Pallaresa basin the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent."
