Avalanche prone locations are located in particular in north-west, north to south-east facing steep terrain, adjacent to the ridgeline and area distant from ridgelines, behind terrain edges as well as in gullies and bowls. They increase in size and frequency with altitude. Wind slabs often lie directly next to blown-off areas, are easily recognisable and should be avoided at all costs. Cracks and whumpfing collapsing sounds when walking on the snow cover, snowpack are a sign of danger."

The transition to the old snowpack (faceted crystals on/under the crust) usually serves as a weak layer.
