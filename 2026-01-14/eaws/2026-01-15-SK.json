        "comment": "In the High , Western, Low Tatras and Mala Fatra Mountains there is a MODERATE avalanche danger above the forest line (i.e. 2nd degree of the 5-part scale). Significant snowfalls from the weekend were often blown by strong winds up to the forest zone. However, on the leeward sides of the mountains (especially SE and E), winds have locally created snow pillows and slabs, the stability of which may be low, especially on steep to very steep slopes. Avalanches can be released locally, especially by large additional loads. The snow will gradually become heavier as the weather warms up, especially at middle altitudes, and small spontaneous avalanches may occur sporadically during the day, mainly from wet snow.",
