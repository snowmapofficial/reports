Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the snowpack surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. In addition, small-sized fresh snowdrifts require special caution in high altitude ridgeline terrain and pass zones. Activities in backcountry demand experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing dangers.",
