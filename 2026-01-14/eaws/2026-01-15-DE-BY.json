Dry slab avalanches can be triggered on steep slopes in the north-west to east to south aspects as well as in gullies and bowls, especially in places with less snow due to low additional loads. The number of avalanche prone locations increases with altitude and slab avalanches can become large in places at high altitudes. Booming noises sometimes indicate danger.\n\nWet snow is also problematic. Wet avalanches can detach themselves in very steep terrain of all aspects, especially at medium altitudes (1000 m - 2000 m). At higher altitudes, extremely steep, sunlit slopes are particularly affected. Wet avalanches reach medium size.",
