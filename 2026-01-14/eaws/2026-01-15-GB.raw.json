        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable crust at lower elevations, much firmer above 850m.  No visibility throughout the day above 750 metres.  Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Best safe travel options will be ridges, wind exposed locations and less steep ground at lower altitudes.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Persistent snowfall throughout the period with rain at lower elevations. Freezing at 900m briefly overnight then at 700m thereafter. Strong South-South-West winds easing to moderate in the early hours.",
        "SnowStability": "Weak windslab development will become deeper and more extensive on all steep North-West through North to East aspects above 900m. New weak cornices expected over most very steep lee slopes. Better stability at lower altitudes, less steep slopes, ridges and all wind exposed locations.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Cold with a sequence of light snow showers on moderate South-West, later strong Southerly winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Persistent light drifting led to weak windslab development on steep North-West through North to East aspects above 900m. Deeper and less well bonded snow was localised at the time of reporting but beginning to become more widespread. Most affected areas are gully exits and coire rims above 900m. Much better stability at lower altitudes and less steep locations.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Initially a bright start, visibility deteriorated through the day. A mix of weight bearing firm snow and a breakable crust at all levels, tiring conditions.  Winds approx 40 - 50 mph over the summits.",
        "Comment": "Winds easing through Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation will fall as snow above 700 metres overnight, mostly dry during the day with the odd snow shower.  Gale force South winds will ease and moderate to strong at dawn, veering South-Westerly.  The 900 metre freezing level will fall to 800 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of unstable windslab will develop on steep wind sheltered North-West to North-East aspects above 800 metres; these will be more isolated and confined to steep banks and burn lines below 800 metres. Areas especially affected will be around coire rims, gully tops and crag aprons. On these aspects fragile cornices will develop.  Elsewhere the old snowpack will remain firm, well bonded and stable.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Some light snowfall on West backing South-South-Westerly winds.  These were strong gusting gale force over the summits. The freezing level at midday was around 900 meters.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "In general the old snowpack has a widespread crust and is generally well bonded throughout.  Accumulations of windslab have developed on North through East to South-East aspects mainly above 900 metres. Instabilities were observed but these were mainly isolated and confined to steep wind sheltered terrain.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
