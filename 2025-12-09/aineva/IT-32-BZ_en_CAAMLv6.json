Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation wet loose snow avalanches are possible below approximately 2600 m. Mostly these are only small but can be released also by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised on extremely steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> In addition further small to medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible.
