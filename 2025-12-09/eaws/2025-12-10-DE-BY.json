Wet sliding snow avalanches slide off spontaneously on extremely steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged. Wet loose snow avalanches detach themselves from the steep rocky terrain when exposed to sunlight. Wet snow avalanches usually remain small.\n\nOld snow can be problematic at high altitudes. Danger spots can be found on very steep slopes in the northern exposures. Slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loads in particular and tend to be small.",
