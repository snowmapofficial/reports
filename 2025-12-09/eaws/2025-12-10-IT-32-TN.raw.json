The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2400 m. Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. Avalanches can additionally in very isolated cases be released in near-ground layers on very steep shady slopes."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Less snow than usual is lying in all altitude zones. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. <br/> The wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the old snowpack in shady places that are protected from the wind. <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The weather will be mild.
