        "comment": "On very steep grassy slopes individual gliding avalanches are possible. They are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. Even during the day small moist snow slides are possible. They can be released by people. <br/> <br/> Especially at the southern border of Aran small wind slabs formed. The fresh wind slabs can in some cases be released easily. <br/> In addition the old wind slabs of recent weeks in the vicinity of peaks are capable of being triggered in very isolated cases still. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",
