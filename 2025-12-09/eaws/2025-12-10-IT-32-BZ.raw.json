Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Mostly avalanches are small. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated mostly small wet loose snow avalanches are possible, in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> In addition further small to medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible. Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady places that are protected from the wind above approximately 2400 m: Avalanche prone weak layers exist deeper in the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m: The weather conditions gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be good over a wide area. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to softening of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations.
