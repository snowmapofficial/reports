In general, only small slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. In addition, slab avalanches can be triggered in the old snow in places by large additional loading. Caution urged on high-altitude, very steep shady slopes."

Older snowdrift accumulations on shady, high-altitude slopes are still prone to triggering. Particularly on high-altitude shady slopes, faceted intermediate layers occur inside the snowpack.
