This applies in particular on sunny slopes, as well as on wind-loaded slopes above approximately 2000 m. From starting zones that have retained some snow in these regions the avalanches can reach the valleys and in some places endanger transportation routes that are exposed. <br/> At low and intermediate altitudes moist avalanches can penetrate even deep layers. <br/> The conditions are very dangerous for backcountry touring.",
        "highlights": "A critical avalanche situation will be encountered over a wide area. The large quantity of fresh snow as well as the often large wind slabs can be released easily or naturally."
