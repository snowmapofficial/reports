        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. Gliding snow remains the main problem, and has receded. Isolated naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches cannot be ruled out on steep stopes which have not yet discharged. Isolated loose-snow slides in steep rough and rocky terrain are possible. Triggering a slab avalanche is only possible in high alpine terrain by large additional loading.",
