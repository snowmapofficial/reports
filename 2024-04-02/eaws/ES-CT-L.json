        "comment": "Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes and at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions, especially at their margins. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in some cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In particular at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in all aspects. Towards the evening the likelihood of avalanches being released will increase further. Sometimes the moist avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur at any time. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection. Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be concluded by around midday.",

The weather will be sunny at times. Some rain will fall in the evening in some localities. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
