Danger zones near to and far from ridges, at entries into gullies and bowls, behind discontinuities. Instable snowdrifts are triggerable as small-to-medium slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading. Freshly generated cornices are brittle, instable, easily triggered.  \r\nIn shady, extremely steep terrain and gullies at high altitudes, isolated (also large-sized) avalanches can be triggered (persistent weak layer). Windblown, exposed surfaces are often icy and hard, acute danger of falling.",

Fresh snowdrift accumulations behind discontinuities on E/S facing slopes, poorly bonded with the surface full of faceted crystals and surface hoar. Elsewhere the old snowpack is melt-freeze encrusted, hard and often icy. The base is generally compact without marked weak layers. Only on steep shady slopes at high altitudes is the expansive metamorphosis weakening the snowpack base. Freshly generated snowdrift accumulations extend to below the treeline and have the character of powder, unlikely to trigger."
