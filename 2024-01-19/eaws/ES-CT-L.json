        "comment": "Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in all aspects. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in extremely steep terrain and in steep rocky terrain. In the valleys bordering the Esera basin and the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and at high altitude the avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
        "highlights": "The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable. The new snow represents the main danger."
