The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m, especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. They are to be avoided as far as possible. Mostly avalanches are only small. Even a small avalanche can sweep winter sport participants along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep sunny slopes individual small dry loose snow avalanches are possible as a consequence of solar radiation. <br/> In addition still more very occasional gliding avalanches are possible, in particular on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m, in particular in the regions with a lot of snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided."

      "comment" : "The conditions are wintry. Up to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Wednesday. The wind has transported the new snow. The fresh wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. They are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack especially on steep shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack consists of faceted crystals. This is particularly the case in the areas with less snow, well off the main Alpine ridge. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations above the tree line. <br/> <br/> Low and intermediate altitudes: Towards its base, the snowpack is moist; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow."
