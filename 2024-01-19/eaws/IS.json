A snow pit from Leyningss\u00falur, near Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur on NE-aspect Jan 17th, showed a steep temperature gradient and faceting. Stability tests gave a sudden planar fracture at medium load on the interface between firn and new snow. Whumpfs observed recently indicate a widespread weakness underneath new snow.
