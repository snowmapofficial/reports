        "comment": "More recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases above approximately 2200 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m, especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. They are to be avoided as far as possible. Mostly avalanches are only small. Even a small avalanche can sweep winter sport participants along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep sunny slopes individual small dry loose snow avalanches are possible as a consequence of solar radiation. <br/> In addition still more very occasional gliding avalanches are possible, in particular on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m, in particular in the regions with a lot of snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
