        "comment": "In the Tatras and Low Tatras above the forest zone there is an CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger, 3rd degree.  Wet snow is the defining avalanche problem. Avalanche release is already possible with a small additional load and spontaneous avalanches are also expected. They will occur mainly on steep slopes and in couloirs where most of the snow fell during the last snowfall. At altitudes up to 2000 m above sea level, gliding avalanches may also occur on grassy slopes.",
