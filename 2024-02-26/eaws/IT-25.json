The detachment will be possible with a low overload, especially on many steep slopes and in particular where old mantle is present (northern exposures). To the south, the entire recent snow cover rests, almost entirely, on unfrozen uncovered ground, a condition that will favor accentuated snow flow phenomena. Numerous natural avalanches, both ground and surface, of large and very large dimensions will be possible.",

New accumulations expected between 20 and 40 cm on the Prealps and Orobie. Avalanche danger 4 strong above the treeline."
