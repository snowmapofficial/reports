        "comment": "Until Saturday the wind will be strong adjacent to ridgelines over a wide area. The wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. As a consequence of a gathering strong wind from northwesterly directions, large surface-area wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines as well as above the tree line. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes of all aspects above approximately 2000 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. The wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above the tree line.",
        "highlights": "In the regions where the wind is stronger danger level 3 (considerable) will be reached."
