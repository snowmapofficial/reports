Overnight, winds will be gale force Southerly, later veering to become Westerly during the day.  The freezing level will briefly rise to above summit levels during the middle of the night before falling to 1100 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: A cold sunny day with light to moderate Easterly winds.  The freezing level was around 600 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: A thin layer of soft snow overlies a firm generally stable snowpack.  Isolated accumulations of moderately bonded windslab are present on South through West to North-West aspects mainly above 1000 metres.  These accumulations are generally shallow, avoidable and mostly confined to wind sheltered locations such as below coire rims and steep rollovers.   The avalanche hazard is Low."
