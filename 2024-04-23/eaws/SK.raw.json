In the previous days 15 to 30 cm of new snow fell in the region, which is unevenly distributed. Due to the current short-term warming, smaller spontaneous avalanches from wet snow are possible. Avalanche release is also possible with higher additional loads, especially on very steep slopes. In the afternoon, as the snowfall increases, avalanches will be possible in places with more new snow, which will be transported locally to leeward places.",
