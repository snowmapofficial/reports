Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow on the ground or atop smooth ground, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible. In rocky terrain, increasingly frequent slides and small loose-snow avalanches are possible.",
