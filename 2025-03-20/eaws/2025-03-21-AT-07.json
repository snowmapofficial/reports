As a consequence of low temperatures and low relative humidity a crust will form on the surface during the course of the night. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing softening of the snowpack. Below the tree line only a little snow is now lying. <br/> <br/> Shady slopes: <br/> As a consequence of a moderate southerly foehn wind, clearly visible wind slabs will form in the regions exposed to the foehn wind. They are in isolated cases prone to triggering on shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Faceted weak layers exist deeper in the old snowpack on little used shady slopes."
