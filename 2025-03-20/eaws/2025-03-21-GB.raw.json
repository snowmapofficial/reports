        "WeatherInfluences": "Southerly winds will strengthen overnight reaching gale force by the morning and potentially storm force during the afternoon. The freezing level will remain above the highest summits and no precipitation is expected.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will begin to thaw on all aspects and elevations. The stability will be generally good, isolated surface instabilities will persist on steeper slopes and convex terrain on Southerly aspects above 900 metres.\r\nThe greatest snow depth will be on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres, more superficial elsewhere.

Older snow will remain firm and icy and be present mainly in steeper locations on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres.
