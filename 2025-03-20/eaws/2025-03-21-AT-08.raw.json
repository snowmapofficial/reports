Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow on the ground or atop smooth ground, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible. In rocky terrain, increasingly frequent slides and small loose-snow avalanches are possible."

At night a breakable crust forms, sometimes capable of bearing loads. On steep north-facing slopes, there is still powder. The old snowpack is well consolidated. On sunny slopes and at lower altitudes the fresh snow will fall on bare ground, the snow is often moist. Not much snow on the ground below 1500m."

In addition, on steep grass-covered slopes where there is sufficient snow or a smooth ground surface, small glide-snow avalanches are still possible. In addition, isolated danger zones occur esp. in ridgeline shday steep terrain and in extremely steep terrain. Isolated slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts.
