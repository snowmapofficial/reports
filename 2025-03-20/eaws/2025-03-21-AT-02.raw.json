Very isolated danger zones also occur on very steep sunny slopes above 2600m. Whumpf noises are indicators of imminent danger. Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. Small snowdrifts can trigger on very steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in high-alpine terrain. Danger zones occur seldom.
