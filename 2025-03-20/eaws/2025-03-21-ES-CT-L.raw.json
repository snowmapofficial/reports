The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. In addition in all aspects, small to medium-sized moist and wet snow slides are to be expected. In addition sometimes easily released wind slabs will form in particular at elevated altitudes as the day progresses. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for caution and restraint."

The violent wind will transport the fresh and old snow significantly. The sleet will give rise as the day progresses to unfavourable bonding of the old snowpack in particular on shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes."
