      "comment" : "Avalanche danger is low. Wet snow is the main problem. Small loose-snow slides can trigger naturally in extremely steep sunny terrain wherever sufficient snow has fallen due to solar radiation. In isolated cases on very steep north-facing slopes at high altitudes, persistent weak layers can be problematic. Near ridgelines, esp in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, small slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading.  In addition, isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible over smooth ground on steep slopes."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "In many places the snowpack is superficially melt-freeze encrusted in early morning hours, later on rapidly softening in the sunshine, superficial layers becoming thoroughly wet in the mild temperatures, and forfeiting their firmness. Otherwise the snowpack is stable and often wet. On south-facing slopes, the ground is bare of snow up to the timberline. In high-altitude zones the near surface snow on shady slopes is still loose and dry. In isolated cases in very steep terrain there is a weak layer at ground level."
