The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used slopes above approximately 2200 m. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found also on sunny slopes in high Alpine regions. <br/> Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of wet loose snow avalanches being released will increase a little. On extremely steep sunny slopes individual small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized natural avalanches are possible from the middle of the day."
