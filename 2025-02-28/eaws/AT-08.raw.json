Danger zones occur at high altitudes esp. on shady ridgeline steep slopes, they can be blanketed by fresh snowfall and difficult to recognize. Caution: even small avalanches or slides can force one to take a fall. Particularly with solar radiation, mostly small loose-snow avalanches can trigger in extremely steep terrain."

Bonding to the old snowpack surface is poor, and deteriorates with ascending altitude. On sunny slopes and at lower altitudes, bonding to the moist old snowpack surface is generally good. The below-average snowpack is generally well consolidated. As temperatures drop, gliding snow activity has receded significantly."
