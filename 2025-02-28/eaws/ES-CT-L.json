        "comment": "As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can to an increasing extent be released easily. The new snow-covered wind slabs of Wednesday can be released in some cases in particular on very steep north and east facing slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. In particular in regions exposed to heavier precipitation and above the tree line the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater.",
