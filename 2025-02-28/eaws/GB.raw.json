Greatest amounts will be found above 900m and mostly confined to steep shady areas in gullies and coire headwalls on mostly North-West to North-Easterly aspects.

        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in specific places.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells.  Winds 20 -30 mph.",
        "Comment": "Some overnight snow is expected above 900 metres. The total forecast amount is a little uncertain so there is the potential for a little more than expected. However, the snow is expected to be fairly moist, with freezing level just around the summits when it falls. This should ensure that this fresh snow will be relatively well bonded within itself and to any existing snowpack. During the day on Saturday, the weather should be dry with bright spells. Looking ahead, freezing levels are forecast to rise during Sunday to just above the tops as another front comes through on Sunday evening.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be some precipitation overnight. This will fall as snow only on the highest summits above 900 metres.  By Saturday morning, Strong South-Westerly winds will have veered West South-Westerly and moderated to Fresh on the tops. Freezing level is forecast to be around 900 metres throughout the period, except for a slight rise and fall overnight Friday into Saturday.",
        "SnowStability": "Some fresh snow will accumulate through Friday night above 900 metres on North through to East aspects. This will only be on the highest summits with coire rims and gully tops being most affected. Amounts are not expected to be significant although there is some slight uncertainty on this, however, what is deposited should be fairly moist and well bonded. South-West slopes will be scoured and below 750 metres, on all aspects there will be little if any snow. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It was a mainly dry and cloudy day with the freezing level being around 900 metres. The winds on the summits were fresh West South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Again, little change from the previous couple of days. There was a very slight amount of fresh snow overnight, above around 800 metres. North to East aspects above 800 metres are holding most snow on steep wind sheltered areas such as coire rims and gully tops. This is composed of recent newer shallow deposits, and the older snowpack patches. Generally this is all well bonded and stable. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Very strong South-South-Westerly winds overnight will decrease to moderate and become Westerly during the day.",
