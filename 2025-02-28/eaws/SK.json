        "comment": "MODERATE avalanche danger (level 2) above the treeline is declared in all mountain ranges. Older snow cover is packed and consolidated. Snowfall has occurred after a prolonged period without precipitation. Up to 30 cm of new snow has fallen. Subsequently, moderate westerly winds blew, moving the snow to the eastern sides, where it formed slab pillows up to 50 cm thick. In addition, on the northern sides of the mountains and in shady locations, there is a dangerous weak layer of soft, fine-grained snow in the snow profile, which is a potential avalanche slip layer. Here, release is already possible with a small additional load. The size of possible avalanches is small or medium. Avalanche release is possible above the forest belt on steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "Watch for windswept conditions in the east and dangerous weak layers in the north."

Most of the new snow has fallen mainly at high altitudes above 1500 m above sea level. New and old snow is very poorly bundled in places. There is a layer of square-grained snow in the snow cover, mainly in the north and in shady locations. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made up of ice overlain by newer snow."
