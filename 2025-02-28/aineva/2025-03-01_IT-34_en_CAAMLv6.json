      "comment" : "The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above the tree line. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> Additionally in some places avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small."

The fresh wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes. In the regions exposed to precipitation several small and medium-sized avalanches occurred naturally."
