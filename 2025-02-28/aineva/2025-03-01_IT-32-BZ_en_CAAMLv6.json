Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. The avalanche prone locations are rather rare and are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Additionally in isolated cases avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. Whumpfing sounds can indicate the danger. <br/> <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small."
