The fresh wind slabs are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and generally at high altitudes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in west to north to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack.",
