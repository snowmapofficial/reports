      "comment" : "Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular at high altitude. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in some cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in the vicinity of peaks. Released avalanches and field observations indicate poor snowpack stability in particular in places that are protected from the wind. <br/> <br/> Extremely steep shady slopes in places that are protected from the wind: In addition dry snow slides are possible. Very steep grassy slopes: Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for defensive route selection. Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack are treacherous. They are to be bypassed in particular in very steep terrain."

      "comment" : "The new snow and wind slabs of the weekend are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in all aspects and generally at elevated altitudes. They are lying on a crust. On Thursday it will be cloudy. The wind will be moderate for a temporary period. The northeasterly wind will transport only a little snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
