Depending on snow depths the fractures can be medium-sized, but at low altitudes the runout zones remain small. Open glide cracks are indicators of potential danger, should be circumvented.\r\nSince New Year\u2019s Day fresh snowdrift accumulations have continually been generated. Danger zones occur above the timberline esp. in extended east-facing aspects behind discontinuities in terrain transitions, triggerable even by 1 person as a small slab avalanche. In encrusted or icy steep terrain, acute danger of falling. Mostly thin fresh snow and drifts are poorly bonded.",
