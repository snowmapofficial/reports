          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above 1800 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Due to fresh snowfall and strong-to-stormy westerly winds, fresh trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations are being generated. Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and size of these zones increase with ascending altitude. Small-to-mediuim sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. The risks of falling need consideration, esp. on hard, icy steep slopes, despite being blanketed by fresh snow. A cautious route selection is advised. Danger of glide-snow avalanches, although their activity has receded: on steep smooth slopes in all aspects below 2200 m, small-to-medium releases are possible, difficult to assess, possible at any time of day. Circumvent glide cracks.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>The fresh snow (sometimes including graupel showers) from New Year’s Eve has been transported by strong winds, the drifts lie deposited on a loose base and are prone to triggering. The old snowpack is stable by and large. Up to intermediate altitudes the snowpack is often moist down to the ground. The weight-load of the fresh snow reinforces the process of gliding over smooth ground. Gliding snow activity has receded.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>Nocturnal hours: From the NW a cold front with intermittent precipitation is moving in, accompanied by strong westerly winds. Thursday daytime: A few snow showers into the morning hours, focal point Allgäu Alps, Lechquellen region and Bregenzerwald. Gradually conditions will improve, intermittent sunshine will prevail. At 2000 m: -4 degrees. Strong to stormy westerly winds at high altitudes.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>On Friday, strong to stormy foehn winds and sunshine. In the afternoon, gray skies. On Friday night, light precipitation will set in, snowfall level will descend. Avalanche danger levels are not expected to change significantly on Friday. On the weekend, danger of dry snow avalanches will increase.</tendencyComment>
