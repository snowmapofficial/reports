        "comment": "In the Western Tatras and in the west of the Low and High Tatras there is an CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger (level 3 ). Due to the westerly winds, most of the new snow has been added in these parts of our mountains. In the last 3 days up to 50 cm of new snow. The altitude snow precipitation varied but above 1600 m above sea level the temperatures were still below 0\u00b0C. Strong north-westerly winds persist. The main problems are therefore new snow and wind blown snow. The steep slopes of the highest altitudes are dangerous, where the wind has created snow slabs and pillows and created cornices. Due to bad weather, wind, fog and snowfall, we do not recommend long and difficult hikes on the ridges. Below 1500 m there was falling wet snow, that is well bonded to old surface.",

Up to 20 cm of new snow has been added, which will be very unevenly distributed due to the wind. The large difference in hardness between the old snow cover and the new snow has caused instability in the snow profile. There are several crusts deeper in the profile, but these do not affect the avalanche situation."
