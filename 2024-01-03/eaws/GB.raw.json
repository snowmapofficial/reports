        "Summary": "SC 4.1.24 Isolated unstable windslab forming above 800m on Westerly through North to North-East aspects. Avalanche hazard Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Icy paths and hillsides.  Cloud base was at 700 metres all day.  Winds approx 10 - 20 mph fresh, cooling.",
        "Comment": "Slow going in soft deep snow at lower levels.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will drop overnight to around 800 metres before rising to 1000 metres by dawn. Snowfall will be mostly overnight before becoming dry during the day. Winds will be moderate from the South-East overnight, easing to the South-South-East during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Snowfall and subsequent drifting, will lead to new unstable accumulations of windslab developing above 800m mainly on Westerly to North aspects. NE aspects may also have localised areas developing. Where new deposits achieve depth over old snow-ice they will only be moderately bonded, especially on steep wind sheltered terrain such as corrie rims, scarp slopes and gully tops. Elsewhere the older snow will be well bonded and very firm at higher levels. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Cloud base was around 700 metres all day. Precipitation generally fell as light rain at lower levels, this turned to sleet and snow at around 1000 metres. Light to moderate winds from the South-East.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Moderately bonded accumulations of windslab are present in steep sheltered terrain above 1000 metres on West to North aspects. These areas are generally localised with wind sheltered features such as gully tops holding greatest amounts. Elsewhere there is still reasonable snow cover above 700 metres with some ice on tracks and trails. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
