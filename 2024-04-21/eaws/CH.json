This also means that fresh wind slabs are smaller and avalanche-prone locations are less prevalent. In general, the amount of new snow will increase significantly with altitude and may significantly exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Wet and gliding avalanche activity is currently very low.

In the north, 60 to 120 cm of snow has fallen widely since Tuesday, which means that large avalanches are possible. Towards the south, the amount of new snow is decreasing appreciably. This also means that fresh wind slabs are smaller and avalanche-prone locations are less prevalent. In general, the amount of new snow will increase significantly with altitude and may significantly exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Wet and gliding avalanche activity is currently very low. Gliding avalanches are still possible in very isolated cases, especially on slopes that had been free of snow prior to these snowfalls.</p>"
