A snow pit was taken in Bl\u00e1fj\u00f6ll (17th of April) that gave CTM#15 at 112 cm and ECTX. Despite the snowpack being mostly stable, cornice collapse is possible and potentially could initiate small slab avalanches where freeze-thaw cycles have had less effect f.x. in gullies and depressions. Thin snow cover and risk of slip and slide falls is high where snow is frozen high in the mountains."
