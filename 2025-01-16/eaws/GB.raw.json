        "Summary": "TO for 17/01 .Light rain for day. FL stays above summits, V.Strong-Gale SW winds. No haz. Forecasts halted until conditions change.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells.  Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Some overnight rain has further eradicated the remaining snow patches. There will be some further light rain tomorrow, with freezing levels staying above the summits. Potentially, by the end of tomorrow, to all intents and purposes there will be practically no snow left in the Torridon area. As this is the case, then after today avalanche forecasts will cease until the snow returns, but the blogs will continue and for further information please refer to the SAIS mountain blog.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It is forecast to be cloudy with some rain and drizzle during the day on Friday. Freezing levels remaining above the summits. Winds will continue to be Very Strong to Gale Force South-Westerly over the summits throughout the period.",
        "SnowStability": "Any remaining isolated patches of snow will be soft and continue to thaw, potentially melting away in the rain during the day. Only snow patches in higher sheltered locations, mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres will possibly remain. There will be insufficient snow for an avalanche hazard and no further avalanche reports will be published for Torridon until conditions change. For further information please refer to the SAIS mountain blog, which will continue.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Cloudy but dry. Summit winds were Gale Force South Westerlies. The freezing level was above the tops with 3 degrees celsius at summit level.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Any remaining wet snow patches are stable and well bonded. These exist primarily on steep East to Southerly aspects above 800 metres.\r\nThe avalanche hazard is Low.",
