      "comment" : "Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular on very steep east and south facing slopes. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in some cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in the vicinity of peaks. Released avalanches and field observations have shown poor snowpack stability in particular at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> Extremely steep shady slopes in places that are protected from the wind: In addition dry snow slides are possible. Very steep grassy slopes: Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for defensive route selection. Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack are treacherous. They are to be bypassed in particular in very steep terrain."

      "comment" : "The soft wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in particular on steep east and south facing slopes and at elevated altitudes. They are lying on a crust. On Thursday it was partly cloudy in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. The easterly wind has transported some snow. The wind slabs are covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
