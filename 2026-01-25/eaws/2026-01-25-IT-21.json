This applies in particular on steep slopes also in areas close to the tree line, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain at intermediate and high altitudes. <br/> <br/> Dry loose snow avalanches and slab avalanches are possible already in the early morning. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are covered with new snow and therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on steep shady slopes.
