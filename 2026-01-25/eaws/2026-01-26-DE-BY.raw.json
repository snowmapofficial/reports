Small slab avalanches can be triggered by small additional loads in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines in the north-west to north to south-east aspect as well as in gullies and bowls. Occasionally, deeper weak layers in the persistent weak layer can be disturbed and avalanches can reach medium size."
