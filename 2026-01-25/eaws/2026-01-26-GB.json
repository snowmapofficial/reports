Remaining cold.\nObserved Weather Influences: A trace of overnight snowfall then generally dry. Cold throughout. Strong East South East winds.\nObservedSnowStability: Good stability in all wind exposed locations where hard or crusty conditions prevail. Older windslab is consolidating on most lee slopes at all altitudes. Sporadic drifting gave rise to some limited new humid windslab on steep, sheltered South West to North aspects above 1000m. Less well bonded snow here tends to be localised and confined to coire rims and gully exits. Some minor cornice development noted high above steeper lee slopes.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate"
