Both fresh and older drift snowpacks as well as the weakly built-up old snowpack can be disturbed, fractures can tear through. Avalanche prone locations increase rapidly from the tree line upwards. They are concentrated from west to north to east, in some places in the southern sector in the high Alps, and generally next to blown-off areas. Drift snow areas should be avoided. Whumpfing collapsing sounds when stepping on the snowpack can indicate danger. The avalanche prone locations are difficult to recognise."
