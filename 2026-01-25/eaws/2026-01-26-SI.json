In the osoles, the snowpack was mostly dry, compacted and hard at the surface, and completely cut at depth. Ridges and peaks were in many places blown down to a crusted or icy base. Particularly near the ridges, areas of blown snow had formed, under which the snowpack was thinned.\n\nSnow has been falling on such a surface above about 1000 m since Friday evening with a strong SW-SW wind. Up to 50 cm of new fallen snow has fallen, which has covered the old snow cover and has not bonded well with it. New snowdrift accumulations have formed, which naturally put additional stress on the old snow cover, which has deep, persistent weak layers."
