There are a few avalanche prone locations in the steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines, at terrain transitions and in steep bowls and gullies, mainly in the northern and eastern sectors of the high altitudes.

The snowpack contains faceted crystals and/or floating snow, especially in the higher elevations. This means that slab avalanches can easily be triggered here. Mostly at higher altitudes, there may be small-scale, sometimes disturbing drifts. In general, there is very little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."
