Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep shady slopes, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above approximately 2200 m. Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

Steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of solar radiation a crust formed on the surface. Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year in all altitude zones."
