Up to 15 cm of new snow has accumulated in the high altitudes of the High and Western Tatras. It fell in combination with very strong winds. The wind created slabs and pillows. The danger is concentrated in places where there is old snow under the slabs. These two layers could not bind well due to the low temperatures.",
