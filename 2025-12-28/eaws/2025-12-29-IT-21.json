Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large natural avalanches are nontheless possible. In addition as the day progresses in particular at the base of rock walls, small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> Artificially triggered avalanches and field observations confirm the complex avalanche situation. <br/> Off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.",
