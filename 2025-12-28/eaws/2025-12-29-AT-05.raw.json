On the one hand, where older wind slab snow has formed a suitable board over a weak layer in the persistent weak layer. On the other hand, close to the surface in the wind slab of the last few days, which is still prone to triggering. Be safe behind ridgelines, in gullies and bowls. In addition to the risk of burial, consideration should be given to the risk of entrainment."

In high, shady slopes, the melt-freeze crust is usually covered by edged snow with no binding. The potential for fracture propagation is generally low due to the overall highly built-up, transformed snow cover, snowpack. Fractures are most possible in low thickness wind slab snow, over the hard old snow foundation from early winter, or very rarely in the vicinity of crusts. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
