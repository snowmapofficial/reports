Beneath the melt-freeze crusts, particularly on steep north-facing slopes, expansively metamorphosed crystals weaken the shallow snowpack. At high altitudes, small-sized snowdrift accumulations occur from place to place. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. Surface hoar frequently has formed. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes.
