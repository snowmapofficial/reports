The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. At very high altitudes in ridgeline terrain, gullies and bowls, freshly generated but usually small-sized snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness."

      "comment" : "The old snowpack generally is superficially melt-freeze encrusted or, in places iced over. It softens up slightly during the daytime hours, particularly on sunny slopes. Beneath the melt-freeze crusts, particularly on steep north-facing slopes, expansively metamorphosed crystals weaken the shallow snowpack. At high altitudes, small-sized snowdrift accumulations occur from place to place. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. Surface hoar frequently has formed. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information from outlying terrain is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services."
