        "comment": "Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are mostly easy to recognise but prone to triggering. On wind-loaded slopes small dry avalanches are possible. In particular in the south and in the east and above approximately 2200 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> In particular areas where the snow cover is rather shallow, shady slopes: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases in particular adjacent to ridgelines. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for caution and restraint. <br/> <br/>",

The fresh and older wind slabs are lying on unfavourable layers in particular on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. Field observations and stability tests confirm this situation. <br/> Sunny slopes as well as low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will hardly soften at all. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
