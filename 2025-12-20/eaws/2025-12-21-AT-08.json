The shallow snowpack is generally well consolidated and low in tensions. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers still occur inside the snowpack. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Since there is only little transportable snow, increasing southerly winds in the foehn-exposed mountain regions can generate only small snowdrift accumulations. Only little information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Service from outlying terrain."
