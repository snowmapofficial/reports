      "comment" : "As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. These can be released by people or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. As the snowfall becomes more intense the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent in the afternoon. Towards the evening probably danger level 2 (moderate) will be reached."

      "comment" : "Some snow will fall until the early morning over a wide area. Sharp decrease in danger of moist avalanches as the temperature drops. The new snow will be deposited on a quite favourable old snowpack in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
