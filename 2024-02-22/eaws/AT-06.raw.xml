          <avActivityHighlights>Considerable avalanche danger due to heavy snowfall</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above the timberline is considerable, below that altitude danger is moderate. Particularly critical: north-facing slopes, since many new snowdrift accumulations will be generated there during the course of the day, but self-restraint is imperative in all aspects. Medium-sized slab and loose-snow avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person on steep slopes. In addition, medium-sized (also large sometimes) naturally triggered avalanches can be expected which could place exposed transportation routes at risk.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>The snowpack base is stable by and large, but there is a persistent weak layer problem on high-altitude shady slopes. On sunny slopes the fundament is isotherm and moist, glides over smooth ground. During the course of the day on Friday, up to 60 cm of fresh snow can be expected, initially accompanied by little wind, but later the southerly winds will transport the snow to north-facing slopes. Fresh snow can have weak layers which weakens the snowpack under the increasing weight.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>On Friday a low over Upper Italy will bring gray skies and wet weather, the peaks will be veiled in clouds, visibility poor, heavy rainfall/snowfall throughout Styria, snowfall level in the Northern Alps below 1000 m already in early morning, also in Niedere Tauern and southern ranges later in the day. By Friday evening in Gurktal and Seetal Alps and Niedere Tauern, up to 60 cm of fresh snow is anticipated. In the remaining ranges, less than 30 cm expected. Esp. in eastern regions, the snowfall forecast is still quite uncertain, it could turn out to be much more. Winds in the Northern Alps will be westerly, brisk, later slackening off. In southern and eastern regions, the southerly winds will intensify. At 2000 m in western regions: -6 degrees, in eastern regions 2 degrees milder.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>During Friday night the snowfall will taper off, clouds will begin to disperse, later on sunshine is expected. The fresh snow and snowdrift problems will persist. Avalanche danger levels are not expected to change significantly.</tendencyComment>

          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above the timberline is considerable, below that altitude danger is moderate. Danger zones occur in all aspects, often difficult to recognize since the snowdrifts are often blanketed by loose fresh fallen snow. Particularly critical: east-facing slopes, but self-restraint is imperative in all aspects. Medium-sized slab and loose-snow avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person on steep slopes. In addition, medium-sized (also large sometimes) naturally triggered avalanches can be expected which could place exposed transportation routes at risk.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>The snowpack base is stable by and large, but there is a persistent weak layer problem on high-altitude shady slopes. On sunny slopes the fundament is isotherm and moist, glides over smooth ground. During the course of the day on Friday, up to 40 cm of fresh snow can be expected, initially accompanied by westerly winds transporting the snow to east-facing slopes and later covering the generated snowdrifts. Fresh snow can have weak layers which weakens the snowpack under the increasing weight.</snowpackStructureComment>

          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above the treeline is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Danger zones occur where there are small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations in extended east-facing terrain: here in some spots a small-to-medium slab avalanche can be triggered by 1 person. In addition, naturally triggered wet-snow slides are possible in all aspects.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>The fundament is stable by and large. During the course of the day on Friday up to 20 cm of fresh snow is expected, the intensifying southerly winds will transport it to north-facing slopes. Moreover there are weak layers inside it.</snowpackStructureComment>
