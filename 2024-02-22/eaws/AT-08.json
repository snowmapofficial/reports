Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain,  behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and increase with ascending altitude. A small-to-medium slab avalanche or loose-snow avalanche can be triggered by 1 person (sometimes larger). Activities in backcountry demand experience in outlying terrain and the ability to assess avalanche dangers on-site. Naturally triggered small slab and loose-snow avalanches in rocky steep terrain are possible. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger below 2600 m at any time of day or night and reach large size. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
