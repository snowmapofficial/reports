        "comment": "The more recent wind slabs can be released in particular on steep shady slopes above the tree line, especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can in very isolated cases penetrate near-ground layers of the snowpack and reach medium size. The mostly small wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. As a consequence of warming and solar radiation, the natural activity of small moist avalanches will increase. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation this applies in particular on very steep sunny slopes in the western and central Prealps. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",
