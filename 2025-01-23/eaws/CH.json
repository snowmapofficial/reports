Only on shady slopes protected from the wind is there still loose, faceted snow on the surface, sometimes with surface hoar. The middle part of the snowpack is also often well consolidated and therefore there is little expectation that avalanches will be triggered deep in the old snowpack.</li><li>South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, the near-surface layers of the snowpack are shaped by the wind, especially in the vicinity of ridgelines and passes. Particularly in areas with little snow in the south and east, the entire snowpack has become faceted in places. Isolated avalanches may be triggered in weak layers.</li></ul>"
