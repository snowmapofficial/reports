Winds were moderate to strong from a Southerly direction, the freezing level was around 500 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Additional light new snow fell mainly above 550 metres. Snow accumulations are currently not deep but are becoming more widespread and achieving depth particularly in wind sheltered locations.
