        "Comment": "Overnight, falling rocks and ice will remain a hazard. This will decrease during the day as the freezing level lowers.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds will be storm force Southerly during the evening, gradually easing after midnight to be very strong generally South-Westerly during the day. Rain at all levels overnight, then from 05:00 precipitation will turn increasingly to snow as the freezing level drops below the summits and to around 750 metres during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight the snowpack will continue to thaw at all levels. During the morning fresh windslab will start to be deposited in wind sheltered areas, mainly on North to East aspects. Initially these will mainly be above 1100 metres but, as the freezing level continues to drop, above 900 metres during the afternoon. Accumulations gaining depth are not expected to be extensive. The surface of the old snowpack will start to refreeze during the day. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

The freezing level will be well above the summits initially and then steadily drop to reach around 800 metres by the end of the forecasting period. Gale force Southerly winds will gradually decrease to strong and veer West-South-West.",

During the day the snowpack will become firmer as the freezing level drops, with generally good stability throughout.
