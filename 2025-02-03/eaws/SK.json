        "comment": "The weather during Tuesday will be influenced by the centre of the pressure above, so we do not expect a significant change in the avalanche situation in the Slovak mountains. Due to the temperature change, the snow cover is settled and well consolidated. Avalanches can be released only sporadically, mainly on the northern slopes of the High and Western Tatras. Large additional loads are needed on steep and very steep slopes. In such a case a small avalanche or avalanche can be expected. The danger is rather due to lack of snow, protruding rocks and rock thresholds, or a small avalanche into exposed terrain.",

The surface is mainly firn snow or crust. Due to rain and subsequent cooling, the surface is mostly hard and icy, softening during the day on sunlit slopes. In the valleys, beware of icy conditions."
