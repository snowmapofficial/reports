The more recent wind slabs are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and generally at elevated altitudes. Above approximately 1800 m snow has fallen especially in the east. The new snow and wind slabs of the last few days are lying on the quite favourable surface of an old snowpack. The new snow has bonded well with the old snowpack."
