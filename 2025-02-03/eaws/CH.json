Before last week's snowfall, the entire old snowpack in Ticino, central Grisons, the Engadine and the Grisons southern valleys was often faceted and loose, especially on shady slopes protected from the wind. In such places, avalanches can take the entire snowpack with them. Fractures in the snowpack can spread over large distances. Avalanche fractures are therefore often extensive and avalanches can sometimes be triggered remotely. The number of avalanche prone locations will decrease only slowly.</p><p>Avalanches are expected north of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, especially in weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack. Fractures in deep layers of the old snowpack are not generally expected here.</p><p>Mostly medium-sized gliding avalanches are still expected.</p>"
