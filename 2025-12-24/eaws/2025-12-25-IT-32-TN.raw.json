Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a strong wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs formed on Wednesday in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These can in some cases be released, even by a single winter sport participant, but they will be small in most cases. Caution is to be exercised in particular on shady slopes above the tree line in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. Avalanches can in isolated cases penetrate deep layers and reach medium size, especially at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 10 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell yesterday above approximately 1200 m. <br/> <br/> The new snow is lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. Hardly any snow is lying on south facing slopes. Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year in all altitude zones."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The conditions will foster a gradual stabilisation of the snow drift accumulations.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-25T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-26T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-25"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","N","E","W","NW"]},{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","N","W","NW"]}],"bulletinID":"8024f1f3-591f-4a1e-bccd-0af78ecb96f1","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Latemar","regionID":"IT-32-TN-09"},{"name":"Southern Adamello","regionID":"IT-32-TN-02"},{"name":"Primiero - Pale di S.
