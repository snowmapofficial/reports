Caution is to be exercised adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."
