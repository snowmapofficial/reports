The wind slabs are difficult even for the trained eye to recognise. In many cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> The new snow can be released very easily in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes. In isolated cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> In particular in the south and in the east the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience and great restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 20 to 30 cm of snow will fall until late in the night above approximately 1500 m. The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. As a consequence of the moderate to strong northerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes and at intermediate and high altitudes. These will become increasingly prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 70 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Slight increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the precipitation.","tendencyType":"increasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-22T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-23T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-22"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","N","E"]},{"problemType":"new_snow","elevation":{"lowerBound":"1500"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","SW","NW","N","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"a197e709-aeb5-4ea1-b264-28f00484dadf","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"considerable","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
