Temperatures will be around 3 degrees at 1500 metres and around 0 degrees at 2000 metres.\n\nOn Wednesday, it will be cloudy all day and visibility will be poor. It may snow lightly from time to time, but no significant amounts will fall. The easterly wind will be strong at times over the Alps. Temperatures will drop significantly at all altitudes. At 1500 metres it will be around -6 degrees, at 2000 metres around -9 degrees."
