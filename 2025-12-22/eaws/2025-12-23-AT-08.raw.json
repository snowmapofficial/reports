In addition, generally small-sized snowdrift accumulations have been generated at very high altitudes. The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses."

Since there is hardly any transportable snow, strong-velocity southerly winds generated only small-sized local snowdrift accumulations. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
