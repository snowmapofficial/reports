        "comment": "The cold fresh snow and all the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects. This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. The somewhat older wind slabs are difficult even for the trained eye to recognise. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate northerly wind, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day in particular adjacent to ridgelines on east, south and west facing slopes. Dry avalanches can in many places be released very easily or triggered naturally. Sometimes they are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",
