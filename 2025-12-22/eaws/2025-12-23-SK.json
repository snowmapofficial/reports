        "comment": "In all mountain ranges where there is still a continuous snow cover (High, Low, Western Tatras) there is only a SMALL avalanche danger. The snow cover has stabilised due to the change in temperature. Spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow may occur sporadically during the day, especially on sunlit slopes. Their danger lies mainly in pushing a person into exposed terrain.",

      "snowpackStructure": {
        "comment": "Weather developments in recent days have caused daytime melting and night-time freezing of the snow cover. This has created a hard, often load-bearing, firn on the surface of the snow cover. The snow cover will freeze even harder and deeper as a result of the coming cold snap. It may soften slightly during the day on sunlit slopes. A continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1300 m and reaches 40 to 70 cm at the highest altitudes. In the Western and High Tatras there is snow from about 1600 m above sea level and its height is only up to 40 cm."
