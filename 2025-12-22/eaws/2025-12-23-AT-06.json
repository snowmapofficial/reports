Medium-high layered clouds will gather on Tuesday and increasingly obscure the sun. However, the summits will remain largely clear and visibility will be passable. It is already a touch cooler than recently, with midday temperatures between -1 and +2 degrees at 2000 metres above sea level. Much colder air will gradually arrive during the night to Wednesday.\nIt will snow on the southern side of the Alps on Wednesday. Especially from the Koralpe to the Pack, significant amounts of new snow are likely to accumulate. 10cm of new fallen snow is expected in the Turrach area and 30-40cm on the Koralpe. Cold, partly brisk north-easterly winds at 1500 metres at -5 degrees."
