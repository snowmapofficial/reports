This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. The somewhat older wind slabs are difficult even for the trained eye to recognise. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate northerly wind, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day in particular adjacent to ridgelines on east, south and west facing slopes. Dry avalanches can in many places be released very easily or triggered naturally. Sometimes they are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen thus far above approximately 1500 m. Sunday: The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. Tuesday: As a consequence of the moderate northerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. The new snow and wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"As a consequence of new snow and wind the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase.
