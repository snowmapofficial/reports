Glaciers were already covered by a continuous layer of old snowabove approximately 3500 m, meaning that avalanches could also occur over large areas. Below this altitude, only a little snow will fall, mostly on bare ground.</p>"

In the high alpine regions, 5 to 20 cm of snow will fall across a wide area, with up to 30 cm from the Rheinwaldhorn to the southern Glarus Alps. There, the avalanche danger will increase at summit levels. On Saturday, it will remain cloudy for longer on the northern flank of the Alps and in northern and central Grisons, but otherwise it will be quite sunny. On Sunday, it will be mostly sunny and mild again with a zero-degree line at 4000 m. A moderate westerly wind will blow on both days.</p><p>Above around 3500 m, mountaineers can still trigger dry avalanches. On Saturday, this danger exists in all aspects, on Sunday mainly on north-facing slopes. The danger of being swept away and falling should also be taken into account. With the sun, wet avalanches are possible, especially on Saturday.</p>"
