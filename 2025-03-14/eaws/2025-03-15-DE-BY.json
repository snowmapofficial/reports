        "comment": "Avalanche danger remains moderate above 1600m; below it is low. Fresh snow is the main problem. Small loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in steep rocky terrain in all aspects. The frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude. In a few wind-exposed locations small slab avalanches can be triggered by a single winter sports enthusiast. The risks of taking a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. Possibility of smaller glide-snow avalanches on steep slopes over smooth ground.",
