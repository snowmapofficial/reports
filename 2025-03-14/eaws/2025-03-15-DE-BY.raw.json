Small loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in steep rocky terrain in all aspects. The frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude. In a few wind-exposed locations small slab avalanches can be triggered by a single winter sports enthusiast. The risks of taking a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. Possibility of smaller glide-snow avalanches on steep slopes over smooth ground."

      "comment" : "A stable old snowpack is blanketed by approx. 20cm of new snow. At intermediate altitudes the snow is moist and has bonded will with the old snowpack surface. In places, weak interim layers, partly consisting of graupel, are embeddeed in the new snow. At higher altitude the snow has bonded slab-like in wind-impacted areas adjacent to ridges. In addition, in such areas bonding with the old snowpack is not always good. The snowpack base is wet widespread."
