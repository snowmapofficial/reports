Warm weather with rain even at the highest altitudes during Monday will melt the snow cover on all exposures and heights. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward areas of the highest elevations will be the most hazardous, where larger amounts of mostly packed snow are concentrated. Spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches of wet snow may also occur during the day on steep to extremely steep terrain. Care should also be taken on the overhangs at the top of ridges, which also become heavier due to the wind.",

Powdery snow can be found only very sporadically on shaded S orientations. In general, snow will continue to set during Monday and will become wetter due to warming, in places with rain showers this wetting will be more intense. Continuous snow cover is found from 1700 m above sea level and is expected to decrease significantly."
