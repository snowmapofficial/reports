      "comment" : "The sleet will give rise to thorough wetting of the old snowpack over a wide area. These conditions will cause a rise in the danger of wet and gliding avalanches in particular on east, north and west facing slopes, in particular below approximately 2400 m. <br/> 5 to 20 cm of snow, and up to 15 cm in some localities, will fall above approximately 2400 m. The moist fresh snow as well as the isolated winds slabs that are forming can be released by a single winter sport participant, in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2500 m. Moist avalanches can additionally in some places be released in the weakly bonded old snow in particular on very steep east, north and west facing slopes. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring, in particular at intermediate and high altitudes."

The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze and will already be soft in the early morning. The high temperatures will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack below approximately 2500 m. These weather conditions will give rise to a loss of strength within the snowpack."
