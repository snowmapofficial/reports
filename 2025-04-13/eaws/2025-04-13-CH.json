In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. In the last few days, however, only a few slab avalanches have been triggered by human activity there.</p><p>On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes, the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated up to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m.</p><p>During the mostly overcast night into Sunday, the snowpack will cool only slightly. This means that the danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase rapidly during the day in the north despite little sunshine. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, moist slab avalanches can also be triggered by human activity in some places.</p>"
