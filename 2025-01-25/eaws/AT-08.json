Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, mostly on W/N/E facing slopes and behind protruberances in the landscape. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.  In isolated cases, small slab avalanches can be triggered on high-altitude extremely steep shady slopes, usually by large additional loading and where the snow is shallow.",
