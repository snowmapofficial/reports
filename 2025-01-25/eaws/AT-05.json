Apart from th danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall need to be taken into consideration.",

Small slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole skiers in some places above the treeline. Danger zones occur also distant from ridgelines, near forest rims, behind protruberances and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls on W/N/E facing slopes. On shady steep slopes, fractures can in isolated cases penetrate down to more deeply embedded weak layers and the releases then grow to larger size. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deep snow.",
