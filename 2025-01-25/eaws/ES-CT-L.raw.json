The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep north and east facing slopes at high altitude and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can in isolated cases be released in the old snowpack especially in places that are protected from the wind. They are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As the moisture increases individual moist snow slides are possible."

The wind was moderate to strong in the vicinity of peaks. <br/> <br/> The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze and will soften during the day. Some snow will fall from the afternoon in some localities. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
