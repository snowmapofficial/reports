Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as a slab avalanche even by minimum additional loading (one sole skier). Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain on NW/N/E facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Releases are mostly small-sized. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall demand consideration.",
