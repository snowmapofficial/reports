Strong, generally Southerly winds overnight will ease slightly during the day, before becoming strong to near gale force East-South-Easterly winds from mid-afternoon. The freezing level will fluctuate around 450 metres throughout the period.\nObserved Weather Influences: Light snow showers to glen level overnight and during the morning, ceased to give a dry and bright afternoon. Serious and sustained wind speeds overnight eased to become gale force Westerlies during the day. Remaining cold with -3.4 degrees centigrade recorded at 930 metres at midday.\nObservedSnowStability: Many areas are wind scoured holding little snow. Moderately to weakly bonded windslab is present in wind sheltered locations on some North, but more predominantly on North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres with accumulations also present below this altitude. Gully tops, corrie rims and steep burn lines are particularly affected. Fragile cornices have formed. The avalanche hazard is Considerable."
