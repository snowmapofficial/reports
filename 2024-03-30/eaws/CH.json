Deeper layers of the snowpack generally contain hardly any distinct weak layers. For more than a week now, there have been no reports of avalanches being triggered by people in deeper layers of the old snowpack. Due to all the new snow, however, fractures in the deep old snowpack in the south are expected to once again be possible.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and on north-facing slopes below approximately 2000 m.
