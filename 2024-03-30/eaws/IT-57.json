        "comment": "Below approximately 1900 m hardly any snow is lying. The older wind slabs are to be found especially in gullies and bowls and at high altitudes. As a consequence of the solar radiation, the likelihood of wet snow slides and avalanches being released will increase. The avalanche prone locations for moist avalanches are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and on steep slopes above approximately 1900 m."
