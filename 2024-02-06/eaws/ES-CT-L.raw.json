      "comment" : "Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will hardly soften at all. <br/> Shady slopes: Towards its surface, the snowpack is faceted and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a resilient crust. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
