        "Summary": "CM for 07/02/24 Generally stable conditions. Isolated areas of shallow windslab on wind sheltered N-E-SE aspects. Hazard is Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Very hard snow ice on remaining snow patches. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Low snow amounts are forecast overnight on showery North-West airstream, be prepared to recalibrate your on the ground assessment If more snow arrives. Firm snow-ice creating exposed runouts.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A cold North-Westerly airstream will bring light snow showers overnight.  Winds will be moderate to fresh from the North-West, backing Westerly during the day. Freezing level will be around 400 meters.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will be frozen and stable.  Some fresh deposits of isolated windslab will form on North-East through East to South-East aspects above 900 meters in wind sheltered locations. Accumulations are not expected to be significant and will be avoidable.  The avalanche hazard will be Low",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Squally snow showers interspersed with blue skies.  Gale force winds from the West-North-West.  Freezing level was  around 700 meters.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack has refrozen and become well bonded, firm and icy.  The greatest cover remains on North through East to South-East aspects above 900 meters.  Small isolated areas of soft new snow can be found in wind-sheltered areas.  The avalanche hazard is Low",

        "Comment": "Remaining cold for the next few days. Any snow showers that reach the Southern Cairngorms are expected to be light. The firm and icy snow patches mean that a slip or fall may have serious consequences.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will fluctuate around 350 metres with only the occasional light snow shower forecast. Overnight very strong North-North-Westerly winds will decrease to become strong and back Westerly, where they will remain throughout the day.",

Largest snow patches will be found above 950 metres on North to East aspects around coire rims, in gully lines and on high plateau areas. Any new snow is not expected to be significant. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
