        "comment": "There is a moderate avalanche danger in the High and Western Tatras above 1800 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially dangerous are western orientations, narrow chutes and places under rock walls. Locally, wind-blown snow slabs and pillows may occur. Their release is possible on steep slopes with high additional loads. Below 1800 m avalanche danger is low. The snow cover here is generally well consolidated due to the sub-zero temperatures.",
