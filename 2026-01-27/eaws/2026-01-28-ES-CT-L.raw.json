The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released very easily in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The new snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. Dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> All aspects: Gliding avalanches can be released at any time of day or night. In isolated cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"15 to 20 cm of snow will fall until late morning above approximately 1500 m. <br/> The sometimes moderate wind will transport the new snow. <br/> <br/> Large-grained weak layers exist in the bottom section of the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered west, north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 120 to 160 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Thursday: The weather will be sunny at times.
