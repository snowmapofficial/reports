The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released very easily in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The new snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. Dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> All aspects: Gliding avalanches can be released at any time of day or night. In isolated cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
