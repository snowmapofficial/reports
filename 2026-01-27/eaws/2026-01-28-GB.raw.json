        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow at all altitudes - very hard going on foot. Knee deep at 600m!  Firm snow - ice on most aspects.  Blizzard and whiteout conditions presenting challenging and serious conditions.  Winds approx 60- 75 mph, blowing us over frequently, serious conditions.",
        "Comment": "An exceptionally wild day on the hill. Afternoon wind gusts were regularly in excess of 100 mph with heavy snowfall throughout the day.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Heavy snowfall will continue through to the early hours, easing thereafter. The freezing level is expected to rise to around 900 metres then drop back to around 750 metres by the end of the day. Fresh winds throughout, initially South-South-East backing to the East by the end of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Moderately to weakly bonded windslab will continue to develop on mainly West to North aspects above 900m. Here, avalanches are likely in steeper, wind sheltered locations such as gully exits, corrie rims and steep convex terrain. Unstable windslab will also be found on both South-West and North-East aspects. Unstable cornices will be found above these locations. Below 900m moderately bonded accumulations will be present in steep lee terrain. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Heavy snowfall above 550 metres, particularly in the afternoon. Winds were extremely strong from the East-South-East and were regularly recorded in excess of 100 mph from midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Deep unstable windslab is present mainly above 800 metres in steep wind sheltered locations on West to North aspects, South-West and North-East aspects are also affected. Corrie rims, gully tops and steep, convex slopes mostly affected with unstable cornices also forming above these locations. Unstable accumulations have also formed in other steep lee locations below this altitude. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Winds approx 75 mph and above, serious and challenging conditions.  Cloudy on the tops. Snow patches above 500m.",
        "Comment": "A calmer day in prospect for Wednesday. The SE airflow continues to bring very little precipitation to the Torridon area, so expect little change over the next few days.",

These are expected to be shallow, isolated and easily avoidable. Patchy snow cover will remain on most aspects above 500 meters, becoming progressively more firm and extensive with height. The historical snowpack will continue to consolidate and is stable in all areas. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Areas affected are wind sheltered locations such as gully tops, corrie rims and ridge crests. Patchy snow cover on all aspects above 500 meters, increasing in coverage and firmness with height.

        "SnowDistribution": "Infernal above 600 metres. Blizzard and whiteout conditions presenting challenging and serious conditions. Winds approx 40-60 mph, with 99 mph recorded on the summit of Cairn Gorm at 1245m. Very hard snow ice on exposed windward slopes.",
        "Comment": "An intense period of snowfall overnight will bring continual drifting under storm force winds, after which a calmer day is expected with fresh to strong winds bringing a welcome change. However, a complex avalanche situation will remain - prudence in route choice and navigation will be an asset in poor visibility.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snowfall is expected throughout the forecast period, initially intense overnight becoming lighter during the day. At first precipitation will fall as snow above 600 metres, later confined to above 750 metres. Winds will be South-Easterly, storm force over night moderating somewhat to become fresh to strong by morning. The freezing level will be around 700 to 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will become deeper and more widespread on steep West to North-East aspects above 800 metres, where avalanches are likely. West through North to North-East aspects will also be affected by cross loading. Crag aprons, gullies and coire rims will be affected, with unstable windslab also presenting after an intense period of snow overnight. Steep banks, convexities and burn lines between 500-800 metres will be affected. Cornices fragile. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Continual snowfall throughout the period, although notably more persistent towards the end of the day. Wet snow from 450 metres, with more consistent snow from 650 metres upwards. Winds were storm force South-Easterlies. The freezing level was 650 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Unstable windslab is present on West through North to North-East aspects above 850 metres, mostly in steep wind sheltered locations. At lower elevations between 600 metres and 850 metres, localised moderately bonded windslab has been deposited becoming deeper as the day progressed. Terrain features such as steep rollovers, convexities and steep banks are mostly affected.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "SnowStability": "Exposed windward slopes will remain scoured and will be firm and icy in places with good general stability. New snow and strong winds will form areas of potentially deep unstable windslab in sheltered gullies and on slopes with a South-West through North to North-Easterly aspect mainly above 800 metres, avalanches are likely. Fragile cornices will also exist above these areas. Cross loading due to wind variations may affect other aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
