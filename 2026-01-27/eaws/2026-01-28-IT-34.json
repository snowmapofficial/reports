        "comment": "Above approximately 800 m snow will fall on Wednesday over a wide area. Over a wide area up to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1500 m. The new snow will be deposited on surface hoar in some places above approximately 1800 m. Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large natural avalanches are possible. In particular adjacent to ridgelines the wind slabs have increased in size in the last two days. The fresh snow and the wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line. Especially here avalanches can be triggered in the faceted old snow. This applies even in case of a small load. The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and natural avalanches serve as an alarm sign. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection. In particular in regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater.",
        "highlights": "New snow, wind slabs and old snow represent the main danger."

The old snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations."
