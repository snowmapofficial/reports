Slab avalanches could still be triggered here. The snow surface is very varied. It is hard, icy in places and can soften somewhat on sunny slopes. In general, there is very little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to many apery and completely blown off areas, there are also filled areas."

Intermittent sunny spells are possible and visibility will be quite good except for occasional slightly diffuse light. The wind will be mostly moderate to brisk from east to south at low altitudes, with strong, sometimes stormy southerly winds to be expected in the high alpine regions above the tree line. This will weaken a little in the afternoon. At 1500 metres around 4 degrees, at 2000 metres around 2 degrees.\nIt will start to snow in the night to Thursday. The snowfall level will be around 500 metres. Thursday will start wintry and there will be widespread new fallen snow. From around midday, it will become increasingly dry and it may clear up in places with some sunshine. The wind will be moderate from the west. It will be -4 degrees at 1500 metres and -6 degrees at 2000 metres."
