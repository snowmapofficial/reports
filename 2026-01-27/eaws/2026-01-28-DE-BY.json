Slab avalanches can be triggered by small additional loads in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines in the north-west to north to east aspect as well as in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can reach medium size in the Allg\u00e4u and when deeper weak layers in the persistent weak layer are disturbed.",
