Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection.","comment":"The sometimes deep wind slabs can be released very easily in all aspects and generally above the tree line. In the regions exposed to a lot of wind caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. Released avalanches and field observations confirm a very dangerous avalanche situation in moderately steep terrain as well. <br/> Dry avalanches can additionally be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> In particular very steep slopes: As a consequence of the new snow dry loose snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience and great restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 15 to 20 cm of snow fell on Wednesday above approximately 1500 m. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. Some snow will fall in the next few hours. Fresh wind slabs will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> Shady slopes, areas where the snow cover is rather shallow: Faceted weak layers exist in the snowpack. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Saturday: Sharp increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of new snow and stormy weather.","tendencyType":"increasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2026-01-09T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-01-10T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-01-09"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NW","N","SE","S","E","W","NE","SW"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NW","N","W","E","NE"]},{"problemType":"new_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["NW","N","SE","S","E","W","NE","SW"]}],"bulletinID":"d23f55d0-6efa-447d-9561-e2c68c449883","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"upperBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"considerable","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
