Attention should be paid to high, freshly blown-in steep slopes adjacent to the ridgeline as well as steep bowls and gullies filled with new debris. Here, small slab avalanches could be triggered in a few places by a small additional load. These avalanche prone locations should be avoided.",

        "comment": "The small amount of new fallen snow has been somewhat displaced by strong winds from the west to north-west in places and is not binding well with the cold, either soft or icy old snowpack or older windslab. Older snowdrift accumulations can contain thin intermediate layers such as angular shapes and are still prone to triggering. The thin snow base, fundament is weakened by the kinetic metamorphism. The snow depths remain very below average and low right up to the high altitudes."

On the northern edge of the Alps, the snowfall level may temporarily rise to over 1000 metres. The afternoon will bring only a little precipitation and a few clear spells will improve visibility at times. Moderate, in some cases brisk westerly winds in the high alpine regions. Temperatures at 1500 m -2 degrees, at 2000 m -5 degrees.\n\nOn Saturday, visibility will often be limited by dense clouds. In addition, light to moderate snowfall will become more frequent during the daytime changes. Brisk to strong winds from westerly directions, peaking at around 70 km/h at exposed high altitudes. Temperatures at 1500 m around -6 degrees, at 2000 m around -10 degrees."
