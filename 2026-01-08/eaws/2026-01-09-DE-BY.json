        "comment": "The avalanche risk is moderate above the tree line and low below it. Wind slabs can be triggered as small or medium slab avalanches by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations are located adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit and distant from ridgelines in steep terrain with aspects from north to east to south as well as in gullies and bowls. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account.",
