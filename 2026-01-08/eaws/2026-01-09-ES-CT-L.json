        "comment": "The sometimes deep wind slabs can be released very easily in all aspects and generally above the tree line. In the regions exposed to a lot of wind caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. Released avalanches and field observations confirm a very dangerous avalanche situation in moderately steep terrain as well. <br/> Dry avalanches can additionally be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> In particular very steep slopes: As a consequence of the new snow dry loose snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience and great restraint.",

At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
