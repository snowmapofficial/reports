Deeper layers of the snowpack are relatively well consolidated in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose. Where fresh and drifted snow is deposited on this weak snowpack, avalanches can start deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>Given ongoing snowfall, even relatively large avalanches are increasingly to be expected in the west. These can entrain fresh snow in their track. However, as there is still little lying snow overall, avalanches will remain within known avalanche tracks.</p>"
