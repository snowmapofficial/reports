Human-triggered avalanches may occur in these upper layers of the snowpack. Otherwise, the snowpack structure is mostly favourable, and hardly any fractures deeper in the snowpack are expected.</p><p>Below approximately 2200 m, the snowpack will remain weakened by the influence of the mild temperatures, especially in the east, where it will be a cloudy night.
