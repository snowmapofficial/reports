In the course of the day the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. Even single winter sport participants can release avalanches in some places, including medium-sized ones. Avalanche prone locations are to be found on wind-loaded slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. At elevated altitudes the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. <br/> <br/> More gliding avalanches are possible, in particular medium-sized ones. This applies in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> On extremely steep slopes small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation."
