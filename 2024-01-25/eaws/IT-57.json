        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation individual mostly small moist and wet avalanches are possible above approximately 1800 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as on very steep sunny slopes. In high Alpine regions there will be only a slight increase in the danger.",
        "highlights": "Wet snow represents the main danger."

        "comment": "At intermediate altitudes a little snow is lying. The sometimes strong wind has transported some snow. In gullies and bowls the wind slabs are larger. These are to be found especially at high altitude. The weather conditions will give rise to significant moistening of the snowpack also at high altitude."
