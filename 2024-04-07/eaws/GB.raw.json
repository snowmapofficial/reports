        "WeatherInfluences": "A trace of snow above 1000 metres this evening, followed by a dry day. Gale force South-Westerly winds overnight will gradually ease to eventually become moderate Southerlies by the very end of the afternoon. Freezing level lowering briefly to 900 metres around daybreak, climbing once again to reach 1300 metres by early afternoon.",
