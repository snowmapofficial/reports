It has become thoroughly wet up to around 3000 m on south- and west-facing slopes, up to around 2500 m on east-facing slopes and up to approximately 2200 m on north-facing slopes. Owing to the warmth and the diffuse solar radiation, this moistening process in the snowpack is advancing rapidly at higher altitudes, where weak layers are becoming wet for the first time and therefore are becoming unstable. As the day progresses, wet and gliding avalanches, including large ones, are to be expected.</p><p>Dry snow can now only be found on steep north-facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. Very few human-triggered avalanches have been reported in recent days.</p>"
