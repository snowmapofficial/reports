        "comment": "Small-area fresh and older trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations are the main danger. Danger zones occur in wind-loaded steep terrain, in gullies and bowls, and behind protruberances in the landscape. Size and frequency of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, isolated slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading.  A cautious route selection is advised. Small-to-mediium glide-snow avalanches are possible only in isolated cases. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
