The fresh wind slabs are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in west to north to east facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack."

In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Hard wind slabs can be released by large loads at their margins in particular. Reports filed by observers and stability tests indicate that the stability of the snowpack varies greatly within a small area above approximately 2200 m."
