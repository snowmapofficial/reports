Slab avalanches can be triggered even by the weight of one sole person. Avalanche prone locations occur in very steep ridgeline terrain in all aspects as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. The releases will mostly be small-sized. The risks of being swept along outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",
