Weak layers inside the old snow can be triggered by one sole skier in all aspects, particularly in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape along the Salzburg border. On shady slopes and in high alpine zones the likelihood of triggering is higher. Caution urged especially in seldom-skied terrain. Whumpf noises and glide-cracks when you step onto the snowpack are indicators of danger. Avalanches can reach medium size. Magnitude and frequency of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude."

The older snowdrifts blanket a weak layer particularly on shady slopes above 2400m. Over the last few days it has been very cold widespread. During the nighttime hours, skies were clear. These weather conditions hinder the consolidation of the weak layers, particularly on shady slopes. The snowpack is highly diverse even over small areas."
