        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack, with only isolated patches remaining above 900 metres. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 10 - 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "Some isolated ice remains which will be prone to collapse. Thawing conditions continuing at least until the weekend.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild conditions continue, remaining mainly dry with sunny periods. Strong South-Westerly winds, possibly very strong at higher elevations. The freezing level will remain well above the summits.",
        "SnowStability": "Any remaining isolated patches of snow will be soft and continue to thaw, potentially melting away.  Only snow patches in higher sheltered locations, mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres will possibly remain. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It continued to be mild at all elevations overnight and through the day. Mainly dry and cloudy with occasional periods of drizzle or light rain, blown in on moderate to fresh West to North-Westerly winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "With the thaw continuing, the already significantly depleted snow cover has further reduced to very isolated insignificant patches of soft wet snow. These patches are mainly on steeper North to East aspects above 900 metres and continue to diminish. Some thawing ice remains at higher elevations and is prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
