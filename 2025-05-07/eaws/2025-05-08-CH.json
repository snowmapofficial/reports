The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions, on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m, and on northern slopes up to a maximum of 2800 m. Significant cooling prevented the progression of the saturation of the snowpack. This appreciably reduced the probability of wet avalanches.
