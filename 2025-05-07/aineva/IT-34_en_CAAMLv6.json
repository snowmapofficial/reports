      "comment" : "In some localities up to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen above approximately 2500 m. Over a wide area up to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Thursday above approximately 2500 m. As a consequence of the precipitation, the likelihood of moist and wet avalanches being released will increase gradually in particular on steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. The surface of the snowpack is hardly frozen at all will already be soft in the early morning. During the morning as well, individual, then as the precipitation becomes heavier more dry and wet avalanches are possible. The new snow can be released by a single winter sport participant. This applies in particular in gullies and bowls on steep slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. <br/> Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection. Moderate avalanche danger will still be encountered."

      "comment" : "Below approximately 2800 m: In many cases new snow is lying on a moist old snowpack. <br/> As a consequence of rain up to high altitudes the snowpack can not consolidate. The rain will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack in all aspects below approximately 2400 m. These conditions will cause a slight weakening of the snowpack. The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. <br/> Below approximately 1900 m hardly any snow is lying."
