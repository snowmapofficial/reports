Danger zones increase with ascending altitude, occur behind discontinuities and in gullies and bowls on W/N/E facing slopes, also distant from ridges, slabs can be triggered by 1 person and can be medium-sized. \r\nDanger of glide-snow avalanches rising in steep sunny grass-covered terrain at all altitudes. Avoid zones below glide cracks. On sunny slopes, isolated small-to-medium naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches possible in steep rocky terrain.",
