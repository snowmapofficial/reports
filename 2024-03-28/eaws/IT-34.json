        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as above the tree line. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above the tree line. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. Some natural avalanches are possible. This applies in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as at the base of rock walls. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. On steep grassy slopes more medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible. As a consequence of warming during the day more frequent moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected. This applies in particular on very steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger. Backcountry touring calls for experience and a certain restraint."
