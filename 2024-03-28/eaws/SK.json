At altitudes above 2000m above sea level, slabs and pillows of wind-blown snow from the cold front passing over the weekend are still present in the eastern and northern troughs and moguls. Avalanche danger is likely on very steep slopes with high additional mechanical loads. Spontaneous avalanches on extremely steep slopes can be expected on salinated slopes due to continued warming. The combination of slabs and cushions of packed snow that melts is very treacherous. Avalanche danger needs to be assessed locally in all orientations.",
