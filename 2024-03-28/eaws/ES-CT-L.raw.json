      "comment" : "The deep wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in particular on shady slopes above the tree line. In isolated cases the avalanches are large and in many cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The prevalence of such avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. <br/> As the rain becomes heavier, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase quickly in all aspects at low and intermediate altitudes. Mostly the avalanches in these regions are medium-sized. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger. Snow sport activities are to be restricted to controlled terrain."
