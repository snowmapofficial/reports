        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 1600 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Fresh and older snowdrifts at high altitudes require caution, they are often blanketed and hard to recognize. Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls; they increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. Medium sized avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Due to warmth and radiation, slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. on sunny slopes. Below 2600 m, glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy.",
