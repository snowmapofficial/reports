        "SnowDistribution": "Snow above 600m, with drifting at higher altitudes. Poor visibility during showers. Winds 30-40 mph, easing from late morning.",
        "Comment": "There is uncertainty about total snow amounts over the next 24 hour period. 10-20cm is possible and if the greater amount materialises the hazard will be greater than indicated in the forecast report.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds will be moderate to strong South-South-Easterly. Snow is expected throughout the period above around 1000 metres. The freezing level will be around 1100 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will form in sheltered areas, mainly on West through North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Unstable cornices will develop over these aspects. Below 1000 metres wet snow instabilities will develop as rain impacts the snowpack. The older windslab will continue to consolidate. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Strong generally South-East winds eased during the afternoon. Light showers fell as snow above around 800 metres. During the afternoon the freezing level rose to 1150 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh windslab has been deposited in sheltered areas, mainly on West through North to North-East aspects above 950 metres. Older windslab present mainly on West through North to East aspects above 900 metres is consolidating in the milder conditions. Cornices are present above many aspects.

        "WeatherInfluences": "Very light intermittent precipitation, falling as snow, initially only above 1100 metres, then from mid-morning above 1050 metres. Light South-Easterly winds throughout. 1150 metre freezing level overnight, 1050 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The vast majority of the snow will be wet but generally stable, with some minor surface instability on the steepest of terrain. Localised pockets of moderately bonded snow may persist in wind sheltered locations on steep South-West through West to North aspects above 1000 metres.  Any remaining cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse, threatening the slopes beneath. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh moderately bonded windslab has formed in wind sheltered locations on South-West through West to North aspects above 800 metres. Small, new cornices have become unstable in the milder conditions and two collapses were heard in action today. Elsewhere the snow is softening but remains generally well bonded.
