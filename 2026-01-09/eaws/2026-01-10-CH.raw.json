The connection to the old surface of the snowpack is poor in many places. Deeper layers of the snowpack are relatively well consolidated in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. South of a line from the Rhône to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose. Where fresh and drifted snow is deposited on this weak snowpack, avalanches can start deeper in the snowpack.</p>"},"tendency":[{"comment":"<h1>Outlook to Monday</h1><p>Snowfall will pick up again in the north overnight to Sunday. Between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, another 20 to 40 cm of snow may fall on the northern flank of the Alps. On Sunday, there will be sunny spells in the north while conditions will be mainly sunny in the south. On Monday, conditions will mainly be overcast in the north, but with only little snowfall. There will be sunny spells in the far south on Monday.</p><p>Avalanche danger will increase overnight to Sunday on the northern flank of the Alps where naturally triggered avalanches are to be expected.
