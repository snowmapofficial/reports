        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable crust below 800m, very tiring conditions.  A day of flat light and no definition.  Winds approx 10mph or less.",
        "Comment": "General consolidating trend but careful route choice necessary due to lingering instability on steeper slopes. New windslab problem is possible but low confidence in projected overnight snowfall amounts for our area.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A few overnight snow showers are possible but it will remain dry during the day. Staying cold. Light to moderate South-East, later Southerly winds.",
        "SnowStability": "In the event of drifting some soft, weak new windslab development is possible on very steep North-West through North to East aspects above 900m. Some lingering instability on selected very steep North-East through South to South-West aspects mainly between 700m and 850m. Cornices will be in place high above all these aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Cold, though the frigid conditions eased a little during the day. Light Easterly winds. No appreciable snowfall at the time of reporting.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Widespread crust at lower elevations. The snowpack continues to consolidate slowly in many locations. Some lingering instability was noted either side of a buried crust, though this is confined to very steep locations from 700m to 850m. Most affected areas are North-East through South to South-West aspects. Cornices also noted high above these places.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

North-West and North aspects will also be affected at high elevations with the possibility of new snow adding depth. Windslab accumulations will be  localised mainly existing in sheltered hollows, corrie rims, ridge flanks, gullies and gully tops. Fragile cornices will remain on similar aspects and altitudes.
