The sometimes more extensive snowdrift accumulations are very prone to disturbance and older ones can contain thin intermediate layers such as angular shapes. The snow depths vary greatly, alternating between blown and wind-slabbed areas."

Temperatures at 1500 m around -6 degrees, at 2000 m around -10 degrees.\n\nOn Sunday, the mountains will be covered in clouds and it may snow a little in the morning. Visibility will improve in the afternoon and clear up in the evening. Brisk westerly wind. At 1500 m around -13 degrees, at 2000 m around -15 degrees."
