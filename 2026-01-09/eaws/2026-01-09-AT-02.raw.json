Wind slabs represent the main danger.","comment":"As a consequence of new snow and strong wind the previously small wind slabs will increase in size as the day progresses. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on southwest to north to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and on steep south facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. In particular in shady places that are protected from the wind avalanches can release the weakly bonded old snow as well and reach medium size. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in gullies and bowls. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"5 to 15 cm of snow has fallen. The strong wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> <br/> The wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack. The old snowpack is faceted and its surface has a crust that is barely capable of bearing a load. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations.
