        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force northwesterly wind, sometimes large wind slabs will form during the course of the night in particular above the tree line. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. Remotely triggered and natural avalanches are possible. <br/> Dry avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size on shady slopes. <br/> All aspects and in places that are protected from the wind: As a consequence of the heavy snowfall more frequent dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected, even medium-sized ones. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
