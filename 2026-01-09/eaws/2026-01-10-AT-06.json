In regions and terrain with little wind, the new fallen snow remains soft and powdery. The fresh wind slab can contain weak layers and often lies on an unstable layer of faceted crystals or surface hoar. In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability."
