If the fracture sweeps away the entire snowpack, the release can grow to medium size. Danger zones are located in all aspects, but especially on shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and spread of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand defensive conduct.",
