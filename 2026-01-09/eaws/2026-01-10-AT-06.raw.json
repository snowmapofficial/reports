      "comment" : "Since Thursday, up to 30 cm of new fallen snow, sometimes interspersed with graupel, has been transported to the eastern sectors, especially in the northern Alps, by strong westerly to north-westerly winds, where it forms bound wind slab. In regions and terrain with little wind, the new fallen snow remains soft and powdery. The fresh wind slab can contain weak layers and often lies on an unstable layer of faceted crystals or surface hoar. In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability."
