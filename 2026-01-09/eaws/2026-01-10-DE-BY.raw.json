Slab avalanches can easily be triggered in blown-in areas, especially on steep slopes with aspects from north-west to east to south and in gullies and bowls with little additional load. Avalanche prone locations can also be found in forest transition areas, forest aisles and clearings. Avalanches can also become large in isolated cases."

The snow depth varies greatly, alternating between blown and drifted snow."
