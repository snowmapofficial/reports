The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. Remotely triggered and natural avalanches are possible. <br/> Dry avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size on shady slopes. <br/> All aspects and in places that are protected from the wind: As a consequence of the heavy snowfall more frequent dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected, even medium-sized ones. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 10 cm of snow has fallen since yesterday above approximately 1400 m. Over a wide area 50 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall on Sunday above approximately 1200 m. The sometimes strong wind will transport the new snow significantly. The wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Shady slopes areas where the snow cover is rather shallow: Faceted weak layers exist in the snowpack. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Sunday: Gradual decrease in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the ceasing of precipitation.
