The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on southwest to north to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and on steep south facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. In particular in shady places that are protected from the wind avalanches can release the weakly bonded old snow as well and reach medium size. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in gullies and bowls. The fresh and older wind slabs can be released easily in many places."
