The snow base is wet, the surface generally soft already in early morning. In spite of storm-strength winds, hardly any new snowdrifts have been generated. But gliding snow masses have increased. The slopes are becoming bare of snow."

From Fishbach Alps to Koralpe, quite sunny weather, but in western regions clouds from a cold front will move in, rainfall will follow. The front will move eastwards as the day progresses, bringing rainfall/snowfall by evening, snowfall level dropping temporarily to 1200 m. Winds will shift to northwesterly, slacken off gradually. At 2000 m: from 6 degrees dropping to -2 degrees by late evening."
