        "comment": "The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence at intermediate and high altitudes. This applies in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> The rain will give rise to thorough wetting of the snowpack over a wide area in particular at low and intermediate altitudes. Gradual increase in danger of moist and wet avalanches as a consequence of the precipitation. In all aspects large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are possible. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. <br/> Avalanches can be released, even by a single winter sport participant.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. As a consequence of the rain moist and wet avalanches are possible."
