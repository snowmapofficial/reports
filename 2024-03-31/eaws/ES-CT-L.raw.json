Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These places are covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of dry and moist avalanches being released will increase for a while in particular on very steep sunny slopes above approximately 1600 m. In isolated cases the avalanches in these regions are medium-sized and in many cases easily released. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection."

Soft weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack especially in shady places that are protected from the wind. <br/> Above approximately 1800 m there are 70 to 110 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
