      "comment" : "The fresh snow and in particular the sometimes deep wind slabs can be released easily, or, in isolated cases naturally in all aspects. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2000 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Released avalanches and field observations confirm poor snowpack stability in particular at the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars. <br/> <br/> Extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and great restraint are required. Careful route selection and spacing between individuals are recommended."

      "comment" : "Over a wide area 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell on Saturday above approximately 1800 m. As a consequence of the strong to storm force northerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations formed. <br/> Towards its surface, the snowpack is unfavourably layered and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
