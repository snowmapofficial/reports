      "comment" : "The snowpack will be generally well bonded. The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. A little new snow to low altitudes. The storm force wind will transport the new snow significantly. The new snow will be deposited on a quite favourable old snowpack. The more recent wind slabs are bonding poorly with the old snowpack."
