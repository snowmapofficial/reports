The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger, caution is to be exercised on very steep slopes at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. <br/> As a consequence of the moderate northeasterly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form on Sunday, in particular along the border between Valais and Italy, along the border with France. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation more small and medium-sized natural dry avalanches are possible. In some places avalanches can penetrate even deep layers.",
