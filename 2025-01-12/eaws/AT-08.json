In ridgeline terrain, in gullies and bowls, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require caution. They are mostly small-sized, but poorly bonded with the old snowpack and thus, prone to triggering,  small - in isolated cases medium-sized - avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier. Danger of glide-snow avalanches still persists, but diminished due to lower temperatures.",

Danger zones occur in wind-loaded steep terrain, in gullies and bowls, and behind protruberances in the landscape. Size and frequency of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, isolated slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading.  A cautious route selection is advised. Small-to-mediium glide-snow avalanches are possible only in isolated cases. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
