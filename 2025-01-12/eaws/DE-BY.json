Isolated avalanche prone locations occur in particular in extremely steep ridgeline terrain in E-S-NW aspects. The risks of of being swept outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",

Terrain at intermediate altitudes which is exposed to wind and sun is often bare of snow or covered only by a few centimeters of snow."
