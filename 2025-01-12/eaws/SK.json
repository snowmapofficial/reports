Avalanches are possible with only a small additional load, especially on steep slopes. Watch out for narrow couloirs, leeward sides of ridges and places under rock walls. Here there may be wind-beaten slabs and cushions that are deposited on hard ground. The two layers are weakly interconnected. Occasionally, medium-sized spontaneous avalanches may also occur, mainly from new snow.",
