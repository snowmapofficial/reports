The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger, caution is to be exercised on very steep slopes at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. <br/> As a consequence of the moderate northeasterly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form on Sunday, in particular along the border between Valais and Italy, along the border with France. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation more small and medium-sized natural dry avalanches are possible. In some places avalanches can penetrate even deep layers."

Up to 2200 m rain has fallen. The westerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. These weather conditions on Friday gave rise to unfavourable bonding of the snowpack in some places in particular along the border with France below approximately 2500 m. Naturally triggered avalanches and reports filed by observers have confirmed this situation. <br/> The weather conditions caused a strengthening of the near-surface layers on Saturday. <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. In all aspects snow depths vary greatly above approximately 2000 m, depending on the infuence of the wind."
