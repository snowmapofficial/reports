        "comment": "The mostly shallow wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes. In particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls the wind slabs will increase in size as the day progresses. They are mostly small but prone to triggering. <br/> Dry avalanches can additionally in some places be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> On very steep grassy slopes and on shady slopes individual gliding avalanches are possible.",
        "highlights": "The mostly small wind slabs represent the main danger. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection."

At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
