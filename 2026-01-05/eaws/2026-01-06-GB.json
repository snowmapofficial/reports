More extensive snowfall, heavy at times, is expected during the day with the freezing level fluctuating briefly to around 800 metres and later back down to 400 metres. The mainly fresh to strong South-Westerly winds veer to the North-West later.\nObserved Weather Influences: A very cold, clear and dry day with winter sun at higher elevations. The temperature at 900 metres was about minus 5 Celsius. Shady glens and corries even at lower elevations remained sub zero. Winds were light from the North-West.\nObservedSnowStability: Light overnight snowfall has done little to change the snowpack. Localised deposits of soft unstable windslab are present on mainly North-East through East to South aspects above 900 metres, especially in wind sheltered hollows, around coire rims, on ridge flanks and gully tops. On other aspects and elevations the snowpack remains shallow with little or no base and is more stable. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
