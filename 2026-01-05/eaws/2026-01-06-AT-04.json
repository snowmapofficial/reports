        "comment": "The avalanche risk is predominantly low. Localised avalanche prone locations with snowdrift accumulations can be found on steep slopes in areas adjacent to the ridgeline, as well as in filled-in bowls and summits. Here, only small slab avalanches could be triggered in a few places in the terrain by low additional loads. Avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise and should be avoided.",

At high altitudes, there are snowdrift accumulations that may contain thin intermediate layers and they often lie on angular forms or on a hardness of old snowpack. The thin snow base, fundament is weakened by the kinetic metamorphism. The snow depths are very below average even at high altitudes."
