It will be very cold, at 1500 metres the temperature will be around -10 degrees, at 2000 metres around -13 degrees.\nOn Wednesday there will be clouds and sun again. It will be mainly windless. In 1500 -11 degrees, in 2000 m -14 degrees."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is predominantly low. Localised avalanche prone locations with snowdrift accumulations can be found on steep slopes in areas adjacent to the ridgeline, as well as in filled-in bowls and summits. Here, only small slab avalanches could be triggered in a few places in the terrain by low additional loads. Avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise and should be avoided."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snow cover, snowpack is characterised by the recent strong to stormy winds and some snowfall at times. At high altitudes, there are snowdrift accumulations that may contain thin intermediate layers and they often lie on angular forms or on a hardness of old snowpack. The thin snow base, fundament is weakened by the kinetic metamorphism. The snow depths are very below average even at high altitudes."
