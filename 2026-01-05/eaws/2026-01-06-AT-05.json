Above around 2400 m, mostly small to maximum medium-sized snow slabs can still be triggered in a few places by low additional loads in the wind slab. The frequency and extent of the danger zones increase slightly with altitude. The danger areas are located adjacent to the ridgeline, but also partly distant from ridgelines behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. In shady slopes, there are also isolated trigger points for small to medium-sized slab avalanches in persistent weak layers that are difficult to trigger.",
