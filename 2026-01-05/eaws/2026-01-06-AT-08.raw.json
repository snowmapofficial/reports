From place to place, slab avalanches can be triggered in the snowdrifts by minimum additional loading and, in isolated cases, grow to medium size. Danger zones are located mostly near ridgelines on shady W-N-E facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and spread of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. In addition, in high alpine regions avalanches can be triggered in isolated cases in the weak snow on very steep shady slopes. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall in outlying terrain also require defensive conduct."

They are often expansively metamorphosed, at low and intermediate altitudes they are melt-freeze encrusted. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the old snowpack. Snow depths at all altitudes continue to be significantly below-average. Only limited information is currently available from backcountry to the Avalanche Warning Services."
