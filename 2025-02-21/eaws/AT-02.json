Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. These danger zones occur seldom. Avalanche releases tend to be small-sized. On very steep sunny slopes, daytime warming and solar radiation make isolated small wet loose snow slides possible. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",
