        "comment": "The weather conditions facilitated a strengthening of the near-surface layers. The mostly shallow wind slabs of the last few days have bonded quite well with the old snowpack. They are unlikely to be released now. <br/> <br/> The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to increasing softening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. This applies at low and intermediate altitudes in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
