        "Summary": "CM for 22.2. Snow generally stable with lingering wet snow instabilities on NW, N and NE above 1000m. Cornices unstable Low hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack. Cloud base was at around 900 metres all day. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Remaining threat from cornice collapse, rock fall and ice fall.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will drop to just beneath the summits during the early hours. Gale force South-South-Westerly winds will decrease steadily to become strong by the end of the forecasting period, while veering South-West. Mostly dry with occasional light showers, falling as snow on the highest tops.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight the snowpack will be wet and continue to thaw, with lingering wet snow instabilities on steep North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres. During the day, the remaining snow will consolidate and be stable throughout. Any remaining cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse, primarily overnight. A light dusting of fresh snow on the summits will be superficial. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Heavy and persistent rain at all levels with the freezing level well above the summits. Gale force Southerly winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is wet throughout and is becoming depleted in all areas. Generally good stability, however lingering wet snow instabilities are present on steep North-West through North to North-East above 1000m. Any remaining cornices are unstable and prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "A showery period, generally of light rain at all levels, with the possibility of sleety snow on the highest summits as the freezing level hovers around 1100 metres during the day. At summit level, the severe Southerly gales will ease slightly, veering gale force South-Westerly in the afternoon.",
