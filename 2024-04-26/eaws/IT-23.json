        "comment": "Snowfall at intermediate altitudes. The wind will be moderate to strong. In the course of the day the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. These are to be assessed with care and prudence, especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. These can sometimes be released, even by a single winter sport participant, in particular on very steep slopes above approximately 2300 m. <br/> As the precipitation becomes more intense dry and moist avalanches are possible in the evening, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases, especially on very steep slopes, and at the base of rock walls in high Alpine regions. <br/> Danger level 3 (considerable) will be reached in the evening in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs represent the main danger. The danger of moist and wet avalanches will increase during the day."

Several small and medium-sized dry avalanches have been released as a consequence of new snow and strong wind. <br/> The old snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a strong melt-freeze crust. Below approximately 2000 m hardly any snow is lying. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes there is still a very large amount of snow. <br/> Monday: The weather was cold. In some localities 2 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen above approximately 2000 m. <br/> Tuesday: The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow. In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack."
