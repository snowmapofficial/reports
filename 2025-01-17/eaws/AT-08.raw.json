These tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes where the snow is shallow and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, slab avalanches can be triggered. A cautious route selection is imperative. At lower altitudes, isolated small avalanches are possibly triggered in extremely steep terrain. Naturally triggered small loose-snow avalanches are possible on extremely steep sunny slopes."

In high-altitude wind-impacted zones and ridgelines, small fresh snowdrift accumulations have been generated. Some older drifts are now blanketed and layers of graupel embedded. More deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack are unlikely to trigger, at most where the snow is shallow and on very steep shady slopes."

They are mostly small-sized, but poorly bonded with the old snowpack and thus, prone to triggering. In risky terrain for falls, evaluate the drifts with caution, small-sized - avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier. Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude, need to be evaluated with caution. Naturally-triggered small loose-snow avalanches possible on extremely steep sunny slopes."
