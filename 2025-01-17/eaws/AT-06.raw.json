Due to new snow and brisk northwesterly winds fresh driftsnow is formed in the extended eastern sectors eventually in forest areas. Danger spots especially behind ridgelines as well as in the high-altitude entries of gullies and bowls slab avalanches can be triggered by small additional loads. In some places avalanches can slab through low weak layers within the old snow and reach medium size."

Fresh snowdrift accumaltions have formed due to northwesterly partially stormy winds. On sunny slopes  the snow has has settled, on shady slopes the settling process is delayed. There loose powder snows presen. Above the treeline  are driftsnow accumulations which are prone to triggering and poorly bonded with the layer below."
