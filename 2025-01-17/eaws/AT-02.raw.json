Weak layers inside the old snow can be triggered by one sole skier in all aspects, particularly in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape along the Salzburg border. On shady slopes and in high alpine zones the likelihood of triggering is higher. Caution urged especially in seldom-skied terrain. Whumpf noises and glide-cracks when you step onto the snowpack are indicators of danger. Avalanches can reach medium size. Magnitude and frequency of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude."
