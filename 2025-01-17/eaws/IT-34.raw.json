The avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In all regions and on steep slopes mostly small avalanches are possible."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snowpack will become generally well bonded. As a consequence of rising temperatures and solar radiation the snow drift accumulations stabilised. In some places wind slabs are lying on soft layers. Weak layers exist deep in the snowpack on shady slopes. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. In all regions only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
