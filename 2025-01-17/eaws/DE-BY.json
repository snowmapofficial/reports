        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. Locally, weak layers in the old snowpack can be problematic. Small slab avalanches can be triggered in particular in places with little snow by large additional loading. Isolated avalanche prone locations occur in extremely steep ridgeline terrain in W/N/E aspects as well as at entries into gullies and bowls. Dangers of being swept away and of taking a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",

        "comment": "Due to mild temperatures the snowpack will settle and stabilize increasingly. There is little snow in south aspects which is mostly encrusted and hard frozen in the morning before softening during the course of the day.  In wind-exposed areas, the snowpack surface is  wind-compacted. At high altitudes in the Berchtesgaden Alpes intensifying easterly winds will locally generate shallow snowdrift accumulations. On shady side slopes at higher altitude there is still loose snow on a stable old snow base. In some places at high altitude, trigger-sensitive intermediate layers persist in the uppermost part of the snowpack. Fracture propagation over wide-spread areas is not likely."
