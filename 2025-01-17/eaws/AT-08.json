These tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes where the snow is shallow and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, slab avalanches can be triggered. A cautious route selection is imperative. At lower altitudes, isolated small avalanches are possibly triggered in extremely steep terrain. Naturally triggered small loose-snow avalanches are possible on extremely steep sunny slopes.",
