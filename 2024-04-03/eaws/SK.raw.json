Above 1500 m above sea level up to 25 cm of new snow has fallen in the last few days. The interface between new and old snow is particularly dangerous. The danger is particularly high when there is a large additional load. It will gradually get warmer. Snow showers may also occur, above 1900 m. Wet avalanches from new snow threaten below 2000 m. Above 1900 m above sea level there are also wind-blown slabs and pillows.",
