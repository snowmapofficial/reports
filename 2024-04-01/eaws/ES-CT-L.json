        "comment": "The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released in particular on very steep shady slopes and at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions, especially at their margins. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in some cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In particular at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is greater. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in all aspects. Sometimes the moist avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur at any time. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be concluded by around midday.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence. Moist snow slides and avalanches as the day progresses."

The weather will be warm. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
