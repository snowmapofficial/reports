In the typical avalanche paths the avalanches can reach a long way and in the majority of cases endanger transportation routes that are exposed.

Very heavy precipitation will fall again during Sunday night into Monday. Deeper layers in the snowpack contain hardly any distinct weak layers. As such, most avalanches will be triggered in the new and drift snow and in some cases will carry along the snow that has fallen over the past few days.

Very heavy precipitation will fall again during Sunday night into Monday. Deeper layers in the snowpack contain hardly any distinct weak layers. As such, most avalanches will be triggered in the new and drift snow and in some cases will carry along the snow that has fallen over the past few days. Owing to the large amount of new snow, however, isolated fractures in deeper layers are still possible, and are likely to occur in the Visp valleys due to the poorer snowpack structure there. Below approximately 2000 m, the snowpack is wet due to the rain.</p><p>In the south, gliding avalanches are expected. These can occasionally become very large due to the high volumes of snow. Gliding avalanches are more rare in the north but they can also be large here in isolated cases.</p>"
