Such avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in pass areas, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep slopes. At intermediate and high altitudes the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. <br/> Dry avalanches can be released in deep layers by large loads. These can reach quite a large size. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep slopes and in steep rocky terrain more loose snow avalanches are possible.",
