On the interface between new and old snow a widespread weakness is likely to have weakened in the cold temperatures lately and thick wind slabs are overlying this layer in places. This last week has been very cold, enhancing the temperature gradient in the snow pack. A snow pit from Leyningss\u00falur, near Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur on NE-aspect Jan 17th, showed a steep temperature gradient and faceting. Stability tests gave a sudden planar fracture at medium load on the interface between firn and new snow. Whumpfs and a remote triggered avalanche observed recently indicate a widespread weakness underneath new snow."
