The largest of these will be situated along the northern Alpine ridge from the Bernese Oberland to the Glarus Alps and in northern Grisons.</p><p>On Thursday, moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected in the sunshine in the areas with fresh snow.</p><p>Conditions in the high Alpine regions were wintry last week as well. Below 3000 m the fresh snow from the last few weeks is lying on top of water-saturated old snowpack. On north-facing slopes above around 3000 m and on other exposures above around 3500 m, the snow that fell over the last week is lying on snowpack that is often still dry. Some large-scale avalanches triggered by ski tourers in the high Alpine regions indicate that the old snowpack in these regions contains some distinct weak layers. These are still likely to be prone to triggering in places.</p>"
