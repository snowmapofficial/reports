The fresh snow is bonding poorly with the melt-freeze encrusted old snowpack, stormy westerly winds transported it mostly to NE/SE facing slopes. On Monday the snowpack will forfeit much of its firmness due to rain and higher temperatures. Only on high altitude shady slopes will the snowpack have greater inner reserves of cold, therefore remain brittle and prone to triggering for longer."

Danger zones esp. on NE/S facing slopes, esp. behind protruberances and at entries into gullies and bowls where snowdrift accumulations can trigger slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading (1 person). Mild temperatures and temporary rain impact will diminish snowpack firmness. Likelihood of wet-snow/glide-snow avalanches will increase. Danger zones esp. on steep grassy slopes at high altitudes and steep hillsides.",

Due to stormy winds on Sunday exposed slopes were windblown, on leeward high altitude slopes snowdrift patches were generated which are poorly bonded with the melt-freeze encrusted snowpack surface. On Monday the snow will become soft due to mild temperatures."
