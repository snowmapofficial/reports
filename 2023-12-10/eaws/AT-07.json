In some places these can penetrate even deep layers and reach large size. Such avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore barely recognisable. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm indicating the danger. Remotely triggered and natural avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> A substantial danger of gliding avalanches exists. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. In the course of the day the activity of gliding avalanches will increase. As a consequence of the rain wet loose snow slides are to be expected, in particular on extremely steep slopes at low and intermediate altitudes. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies on very steep slopes above approximately 2200 m. Avalanches can reach large size.",
