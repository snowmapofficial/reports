Winds are gusting, creating wind-rolled slabs and cushions just below ridges, in leeward bulges and troughs, which are not connected to the hard ground. They can be released with only a small additional load on slopes mainly above 40°. Small wet avalanches may occur in the forest zone due to warming from loose wet snow from the last snowfall.",
