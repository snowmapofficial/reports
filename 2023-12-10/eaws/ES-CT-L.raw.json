      "comment" : "On Saturday in extremely steep terrain numerous small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches occurred naturally, in particular avalanches with origins in high-altitude starting zones. <br/> As a consequence of falling temperatures and low relative humidity a crust will form on the surface during the night. These conditions will foster a substantial stabilisation of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
