Mostly avalanches are medium-sized and can be released even by a single winter sport participant. In the regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 3 (considerable) the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies on very steep slopes above approximately 2400 m. Avalanches can reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> On steep slopes small to medium-sized gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible below approximately 2000 m."

      "comment" : "Over a wide area 10 to 20 cm of snow will fall. As a consequence of the strong wind the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. This applies especially in the regions with a lot of snow. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on shady slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> The rain will give rise to softening of the snowpack in some cases at low and intermediate altitudes. <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the centre of the snowpack in particular above approximately 2400 m."
