        "Summary": "Moderate hazard. Weak windslab N to SE aspects above 950m. Weak cornices overhanging many of these places.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Covering of snow at all altitudes with drifting at altitude.  Cloud base was at 850 metres all day.  Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Poor stability overnight and early morning. Improved stability by the end of the day. Weak, collapse prone cornices.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers dying out early evening then generally dry for the rest of the period. Remaining cold. Moderate, West- South-Westerly airflow becoming light South-Easterly before dawn.",
        "SnowStability": "A period of poorer stability overnight on North to South-East aspects above 950m. Weak, collapse prone cornices will be in place over steeper recent lee slopes. Instability will persist at the highest altitudes in these locations during the day but will be confined to coire rims and gully exits. Some early consolidation expected in recently drifted snow in most locations and altitudes by the end of the day.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow showers tapered out during the day. Generally cold but a little milder at times during the day. Moderate, South-West winds became West-South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Covering of fresh snow above 750m. Weak windslab built quickly on steep North to South East aspects but only achieved significant depth above 950m on steep coire backwalls and gullies. Some roller ball activity noted on a few South East and East aspects around 900m but fluctuating temperatures at or below this altitude induced better general snowpack stability. New weak cornices in place above all recent steep lee slopes.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in confined to coire headwalls and gully lines. Cloudy on the tops, and in showers but with some bright spells at lower elevations. Winds 20-30 mph with some occasional stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "The existing snowpack will remain firm and stable, and may present serious consequences in the event of an uncontrolled fall or slide.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A mostly dry day is expected. Winds will be very strong West-South-Westerly, gradually backing to become moderate South-South-Easterly during the day. At the end of the period the winds are expected to be light Northerlies. The freezing level will be around 700 to 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will remain well bonded and stable. Firm snow will be found on North-West through North to East aspects, in locations such as coire headwalls and gully lines above 1000 metres. Deposits of windblown snow will remain in steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims of a North-West to North-East aspect, mostly presenting as well bonded patches overlying the existing firm snowpack. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers fell through much of the period above 800 metres. Winds were very strong West-South-Westerly, and the freezing level was around 900 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded and stable in most areas with a firm surface above 900 metres. The greatest snow cover is found on North-West through North to East aspects, in locations such as coire headwalls and gully lines. Deposits of windblown snow are present in steep wind sheltered locations, these were observed to be shallow and well bonded to the underlying snowpack. Elsewhere, a trace of new snow was noted above 800 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in specific places. Cloudy on the tops with an occasional bright spell.  Winds 20 -30 mph with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "There was less snow than expected on the hills today. Most likely due to a combination of it being slightly warmer than forecast, and the precipitation amounts were slightly less. Little change expected tomorrow, with a largely dry day and light variable winds. A few snow showers expected on Thursday but amounts not significant, then another dry day is forecast on Friday. So not as much change this week as we had hoped for.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "After some showers this evening, it will be a largely dry night and through Wednesday. Fresh, South-Westerly winds overnight will decrease to light and back continuously during the day through East to more Northerly by dusk. Freezing level is forecast to remain around 750 metres throughout the period.",
        "SnowStability": "Small accumulations of fresh snow will continue to develop, on steep wind sheltered North through to East aspects, above 800 metres. Amounts are not forecast to be significant, but where they gain depth at the highest elevations, there may be snowpack weaknesses. Coire rims and gully tops will be most affected. Other aspects will generally be snow free or scoured and safe. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "There were scattered showers during the day of sleet and snow above 800 metres. Freezing level was just below the summits, at around 900 metres. Winds on the tops were Strong West-South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Some fresh snow was evident and settling above 900 metres, but amounts were not significant. The older isolated snow patches remain stable, isothermal and well bonded. The largest of these remaining patches can be found on steep North to East aspects above 800 metres.\r\nThe avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "After some overnight fresh snowfall above 600 metres it will be a dry day.  Freezing level hovering around 700-800 meters.

The existing old snowpack will be icy with good stability, wind exposed terrain mainly bare. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
