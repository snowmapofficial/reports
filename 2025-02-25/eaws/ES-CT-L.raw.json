      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, easily released wind slabs will form by the early morning especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as above the tree line. Mostly they are small. In addition as the day progresses in all aspects, small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized dry and moist snow slides are to be expected. They can be released easily or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in very isolated cases in particular on steep, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In isolated cases these are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. Caution is to be exercised in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation near the border with France, near the border with Ribagor√ßa and Pallars and at the border to Benasque."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "5 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Wednesday above approximately 1500 m. The sometimes strong wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. The new snow and wind slabs will be deposited on soft layers in particular on wind-protected shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. The solar radiation will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes. Faceted weak layers exist in the centre of the old snowpack in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying."
