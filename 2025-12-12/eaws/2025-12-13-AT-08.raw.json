The risks of injuries from being forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. As a result of daytime warming and solar radiation, isolated, generally small-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible on steep slopes which have not yet discharged. Glide cracks are signals of possibly imminent danger."
