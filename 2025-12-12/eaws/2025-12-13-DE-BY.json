        "comment": "The avalanche danger is moderate above 2200 metres and low below. Old snow is the main problem. Slab avalanches can be triggered at high altitudes on very steep slopes in the northern exposures, especially with high additional loads. Far-reaching break propagation and thus avalanches of medium size are possible in wind-protected hollows. Otherwise, avalanches usually remain small and the risk of falling must be taken into account.\n  \nIndividual sliding snow avalanches can spontaneously slide down extremely steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged. These are usually small.",

In places, the top half metre of snow still has a layer of surface frost that is prone to disruption. Sliding movements still occur occasionally on smooth ground. On the south side, the ground is increasingly pitting in the middle layers."
