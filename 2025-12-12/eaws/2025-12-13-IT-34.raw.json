Avalanches can in isolated cases be triggered in the old snowpack. <br/> Over a wide area only a little snow is now lying. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface during the last three days."
