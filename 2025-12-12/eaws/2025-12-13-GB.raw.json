        "WeatherInfluences": "Some overnight showers will fall as snow above 900 metres. During the morning a band of precipitation will reach the area. Initially this will fall as snow but soon turning to rain at all levels as the freezing level rises well above the summits. Strong winds will be from the South-South-West.",
        "SnowStability": "Any fresh deposits overnight and during the morning are expected to be shallow and isolated. As the temperature rises the snowpack will become wet and slowly thaw. The  snowpack will remain patchy and found mainly above 1000 metres. Stability will generally be good throughout. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The old patchy snowpack has frozen solid and consolidated in the cooler conditions. It is hard, icy and stable. There was a dusting a fresh snow, but deposits were not significant. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
