They are sometimes deep and in some cases prone to triggering. Weak layers deep in the old snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In many cases the dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> On steep grassy slopes more gliding avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on sunny slopes above approximately 2000 m and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> In particular low altitudes: As the penetration by moisture increases moist snow slides are possible. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: The wind slabs have bonded poorly. <br/> Wind-protected shady slopes: Towards its surface, the snowpack is faceted and its surface consists of surface hoar. <br/> Shady slopes, areas where the snow cover is rather shallow: Large-grained weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> Saturday: The weather will be cloudy over a wide area. Some snow will fall. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The avalanche danger will persist.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2026-01-03T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-01-04T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-01-03"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","E","N"]},{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["S","SW","NE","NW","E","W","N","SE"]}],"bulletinID":"ce53a82e-f68c-4604-b0c0-e5956e05e23c","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
