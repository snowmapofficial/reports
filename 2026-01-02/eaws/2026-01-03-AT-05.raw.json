Slab avalanches can still be triggered in some places above around 2400 m by small additional loads (individual people) in the wind slab and can occasionally be of medium size. Danger areas due to wind slab avalanches are usually easy to recognise and are located particularly adjacent to the ridgeline, behind the edges of the terrain and in gullies and bowls. In shady slopes, there are also isolated trigger points for small to medium-sized slab avalanches in persistent weak layers that are difficult to disturb. There is a risk of burial in particular in the vicinity of terrain traps."

      "comment" : "The snow cover, snowpack is highly variable. On the surface, there are blown-in areas with clearly recognisable snowdrift accumulations next to blown-off areas where a melt-freeze crust forms the snow surface. Beneath this is a fluffy layer of faceted crystals and melt-freeze crusts. Prone to triggering weak layers are most likely to be found in the fresh drift snow packs and at the transition to the melt-freeze crust. Due to the overall heavily built-up transformed snow cover, the fracture propagation potential deeper in the old snowpack is generally low, but in isolated places a prone to triggering combination of weak layer and snowpack cannot be ruled out. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
