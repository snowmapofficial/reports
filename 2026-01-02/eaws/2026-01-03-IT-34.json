        "comment": "<br/> Adjacent to ridgelines as well as at high altitude further wind slabs formed. In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded poorly together. The fresh and older wind slabs are mostly rather small but prone to triggering. The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on extremely steep shady slopes. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example in particular above approximately 1800 m, as well as on extremely steep shady slopes. <br/> Precarious weak layers exist in the snowpack on shady slopes. Whumpfing sounds serve as an alarm indicating the danger. Avalanches can in isolated cases be triggered in the old snowpack and reach medium size in particular on extremely steep shady slopes. Avalanches can additionally be released, even by small loads in isolated cases.",
