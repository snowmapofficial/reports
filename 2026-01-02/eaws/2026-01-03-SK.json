The avalanche danger is local, concentrated in places where the wind blows a larger amount of new snow. This is in the form of unstable snow slabs and pillows in couloirs, moguls and under saddles. Avalanche release on such steep slopes, where old frozen snow is still under the new snow, is possible, especially with additional loads. Larger spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",
