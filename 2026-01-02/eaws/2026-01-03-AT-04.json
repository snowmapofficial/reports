        "comment": "Moderate avalanche danger due to wind slab in the higher elevations. Some more new fallen snow and continued strong to stormy winds from the west to northwest. Avalanche prone locations due to wind slab are mainly in areas adjacent to the ridgelines, bowls, gullies and in places also distant from ridgelines. The triggering of small to medium slab avalanches is possible due to low additional loads. The mostly easily recognisable avalanche prone locations should be avoided.",

The drifting snow layers of different ages may contain thin intermediate layers.

The snow depths are very below average, even at high altitudes."
