        "SnowDistribution": "Snow showers fell at all levels accumulations vary in depth windward slopes partially and icy in places. Poor visibility during the morning cleare spells around midday. Fresh to strong cold North-Westerly winds.",
        "Comment": "Cold conditions to continue, windy over the high summits with more light snowfall. The snowpack should become more widespread.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Freezing at most levels with a cold, showery North to North-Westerly airflow. Further snow showers mainly Friday night and Saturday morning accompanied by strong to gale force North-Westerly winds. Drier conditions are expected from mid morning onward.",
        "SnowStability": "Deposits of poorly bonded windslab will gain depth becoming more widespread through the period. Greatest accumulations in wind sheltered areas primarily on East to South aspects above 950 metres and should be avoidable. Most affected areas will be where windslab overlies the old frozen deposits around gully tops, coire rims and ridge flanks. Below this level and on windward aspects stability will be better. Fragile cornices will also continue to form. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Most affected areas are where deeper accumulations have formed on older frozen deposits particularly  around gully tops, coire rims and ridge flanks. Fragile cornices were also noted.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Unstable windslab will continue to develop and deepen in wind sheltered and mostly specific locations on Easterly through South to Westerly aspects mostly above 700m with gully tops, ridge flanks, coire head walls and rims mostly affected. At lower elevations and mainly above 500m localised windslab accumulations will also be present in steep banks and burn lines. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Unstable windslab is building above this level due significant drifting, especially in wind sheltered locations on Easterly through South to South-Westerly aspects. Gully tops, Ridge flanks, coire head walls and rims mostly affected. At lower elevations deep, localised windslab accumulations are forming in steep banks and burn lines.
