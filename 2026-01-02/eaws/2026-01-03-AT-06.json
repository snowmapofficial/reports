However, the stormy westerly winds will continue to cause drifting, resulting in prone-to-triggering snowdrift accumulations. These can be triggered by individuals as small to medium-sized slab avalanches, especially behind broad ridges and ridgelines in northern, eastern and southern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are easily recognisable if visibility is good.",

The drifting snow of the last few days has mostly deposited on soft layers in transition to persistent weak layers or older wind slab.

The connection between them is poor at high altitudes. There are also weak layers of faceted crystals in the old snow foundation, especially on the shady slopes. The composition and thickness of the snow cover, snowpack varies greatly in a small area. There is often insufficient old snowpack."
