New snow from the last snowfall period was often blown by strong winds into the forest zone, locally smaller slabs or pillows of wind-drifted snow can be found on the NW facing slopes. Generally, however, the snow cover has warmed up in recent days and with the subsequent overnight freezing has settled and stabilised. The main avalanche problem is wet snow, which will cause solar radiation during the day, especially on steep, sun-exposed south-facing slopes. Spontaneous avalanches from wet snow may occur during the day.",

      "comment" : "In the High, Western and central part of the Low Tatras there is a SMALL avalanche danger (1st degree of the 5-part scale). Significant snowfalls from the last snowfall period were often blown by strong winds into the forest zone. However, on the leeward sides of the mountains (mainly W, NW and N), snow pillows and slabs are locally formed by the wind at the highest elevations and may be less stable, especially on steep to very steep shady slopes. Avalanche release is occasionally possible with high additional loads. At mid-altitudes the snow has settled and stabilised due to the temperature change. During the day, on south-facing, sunny slopes, it will gradually become heavier, reducing its stability, and small spontaneous avalanches may occur sporadically, mainly from moist to wet snow.",
