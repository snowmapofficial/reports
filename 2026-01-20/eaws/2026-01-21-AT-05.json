Both fresh and older drift snowpacks as well as the weakly built-up old snowpack can be disturbed, whereby fractures can tear through. Avalanche prone locations are found in north-west, north to east facing steep terrain, but also in the southern sector and generally next to blown-off areas. They increase rapidly from the tree line onwards. Isolated remote triggering is still possible, drifting snow areas should be avoided on a large scale. Whumpfing collapsing sounds can indicate danger. Terrain traps are less full due to a lack of snow and are therefore more effective.",
