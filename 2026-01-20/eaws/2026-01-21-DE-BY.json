Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations can be found at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes.",

The snowpack base consists mainly of faceted crystals. Up to medium altitudes, the snow surface is dominated by partly stable crust and thin breakable crust at higher altitudes. On the sunny slopes, it is frozen hard in the morning and firns up during the daytime changes. At the highest elevations, there is some fresh wind slab on a small scale. The snow depths are below average."
