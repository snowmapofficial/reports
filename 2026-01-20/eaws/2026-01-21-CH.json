These are particularly common south of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine and on the southern flank of the Alps. In these weak layers, medium-sized and sometimes even large avalanches can still be triggered by human activity. The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes in Valais, as well as in northern Grisons, is particularly prone to triggering. Remote triggering is still possible in these areas in particular. The most recent avalanches triggered in the old snowpack were reported on the northern flank of the Alps at the weekend.</p>"
