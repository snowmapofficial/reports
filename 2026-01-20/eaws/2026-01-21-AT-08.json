        "comment": "A single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches in the old snow. If a release sweeps away the entire snowpack the avalanche can grow to medium size. Danger zones are located expecially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers. In addition, as a result of foehn-wind impact, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been generated particularly in ridgline and pass areas.",
