        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack.  Cloud base was at 700 metres all day.  Winds 30 -40 mph, progress difficult and tiring, blowing us over on occasions.",
        "Comment": "Wednesday likely to be a difficult day on the hill.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation throughout the period with rain turning to snow as the freezing level drops to 800 metres by afternoon. Storm force winds from the South-East, will ease around dawn but slowly strengthen again throughout the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Accumulations of rapidly forming unstable windslab will  build, mainly on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gully tops will be most affected. Steep lee terrain at lower levels will also be affected. Fragile cornices will also start to develop. The existing old snow pack will remain very firm and icy with good stability throughout. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A cloudy day with light rain in the morning. The temperature was around  +2 degrees at 900 metres mid-morning. Winds were South-East to South-South-East, becoming gale force by afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is thawing at all levels becoming moist and soft but demonstrating good stability. Snow loss is evident at lower levels but cover remains good above 900 metres. Cornice stability remains suspect. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snow cover below 650 metres deeper snow moist deposits above 800 metres. Poor visibility throughout most of the day above 900 metres. South-Easterly winds were 15-20 mph over the higher summits.",

        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will continue to consolidate and stability is expected to generally be good. Localised and shallow accumulations of new windslab will develop overnight and into Wednesday morning mostly on North-West to North-Easterly aspects above 800 metres these are not anticipated to be deep or extensive and should to be avoidable. Most affected locations will be gully tops and steep coire rims above 900 metres The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After the fantastic Northern lights last night the weather returned to repeat it self similar to the past few days with limited precipitation, poor visibility in the morning then clearer and brighter spells in the afternoon. The freezing level was around 1100 metres today winds were moderate in strength form a South-Easterly direction. Some early morning precipitation fell as a light dusting of snow over the higher summits otherwise a mainly dry day.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Milder conditions are generally affecting the area with fluctuating freezing levels this has helped with the consolidating trend in the snowpack. Above 900 metres the snowpack is generally firmer, below this level it is moist but also stable. Greatest snow amounts are above 750 metres on North-West through North to Easterly aspects. Weak cornices are also present on similar aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

There will be occasional periods of snow above around 800 metres. The most persistent outbreaks are expected during the morning. The freezing level will be around 900 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "New accumulations of unstable windslab will rapidly develop on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Areas especially affected will be around coire rims, gully tops and crag aprons. On these aspects fragile cornices will develop. Elsewhere the older snowpack will continue to consolidate and be generally well bonded and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

Heavy cornices are prone to collapse and are mainly present on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.
