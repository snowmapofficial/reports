        "comment": "Avalanche danger above the timberline is moderate. Main problem: snowdrifts in all aspects. Danger zones occur near ridgelines, at entries into gullies and bowls and behind discontinuities in the terrain. In isolated cases in wind-exposed terrain below the treeline, instable snowdrift patches have been generated. Wherever the snow has bonded to form a slab, even 1 person can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche. In shady, extremely steep terrain and gullies at high altitudes, isolated large-sized avalanches can be triggered (start of a persistent-weak-layer problem). Windblown surfaces are often hardened or icy: acute danger of falling.",
