      "comment" : "The danger of wet avalanches will persist. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects below approximately 2800 m. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes individual natural avalanches are possible as the penetration by moisture increases. These can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size in the regions with a lot of snow. In some cases, the avalanches can reach areas without any snow cover in steep gullies. The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring. <br/> <br/> Fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2800 m. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls."

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already be soft in the early morning. Up to high altitudes rain will fall in some localities. The weather conditions will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack below approximately 2800 m. This situation will give rise to a loss of strength within the snowpack especially on west, north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: 10 to 20 cm of snow has fallen. In some localities up to 10 cm of snow will fall on Wednesday. As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong southerly wind, rather small wind slabs will form. These are lying on soft layers on very steep shady slopes."
