On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes, the majority is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated up to around 2000 m. The snowpack is becoming water-saturated up to around 2400 m on northern slopes. When water first comes into contact with weak layers, these layers quickly become even weaker. This mainly affects southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, where there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. Here, moist slab avalanches can also be triggered by human activity in some places.

On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes, the majority is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated up to around 2000 m. The snowpack is becoming water-saturated up to around 2400 m on northern slopes. When water first comes into contact with weak layers, these layers quickly become even weaker. This mainly affects southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, where there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. Here, moist slab avalanches can also be triggered by human activity in some places.
