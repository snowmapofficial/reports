Isolated wet loose-snow avalanches can be expected in extremely steep terrain which has not yet discharged. Broken cornices are on the increase. Wet glide-snow avalanches are possible over smooth groundm, on grass-covered slopes, in sparsely wooded zones and over smooth rock plates. At high altitudes there is still sufficient snow, esp. on shady slopes, for avalanches to grow to medium size."
