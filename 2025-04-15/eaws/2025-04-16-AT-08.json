Danger zones for wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches occur on very steep shady slopes below 2400m, on very steep sunny slopes below 2800m. Due to higher daytime temperatures and solar radiation, the danger of wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches will increase already during the morning hours. Wet-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in all aspects in high-altutude starting zones and grow to medium size. If they sweep along the thoroughly wet old snowpack they can in isolated starting zones where snow is sufficient grow to large size. In addition, the old snowpack can be triggered by large additional loading in extremely steep terrain.  Danger zones occur in seldom-skied backcountry touring terrain, esp. on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection.",
