      "comment" : "Moderate avalanche danger in the high Tatras and Low Tatras (above 1800 m asl), degree 2. Due to rain and warming, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes are dangerous, where a larger amount of newer blown snow is concentrated. Avalanches can be triggered here, especially with higher additional loads, but spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow can also occur. Care should also be taken on the overpasses in the upper parts of the ridges. On isolated steep slopes with grassy surface, gliding  avalanches may also occur.",
