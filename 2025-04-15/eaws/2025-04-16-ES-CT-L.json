        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate wind from northerly directions, wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at elevated altitudes. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized and easily released. Small to medium-sized dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected in particular in steep rocky terrain. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended.",
