        "SnowDistribution": "Little snow below 650m but with drifting at higher altitudes. Poor visibility throughout the day above 650 metres. Winds 20-30 mph, progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "A better day expected tomorrow as a transient ridge of high pressure crosses the area, before unsettled conditions likely to return early next week.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers will largely peter out early morning to give a mainly dry afternoon. The very strong North-Westerly winds will gradually ease through the day, becoming light North-Easterly by the end of the period. The freezing level will fluctuate between 700 and 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised areas of moderately bonded windslab will continue to build overnight and during the morning in many wind sheltered locations. Most notably, coire rims, ridge flanks and gullies will be affected, mainly North-East, through East to South aspects, generally above 750 metres. New cornice growth will be fragile. Elsewhere, fresh snow deposits will be shallow and high windward aspects will be scoured. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Frequent, occasionally heavy and blustery showers, wintry generally above 650 metres, driven on a strong to gale force North-Westerly airflow. Freezing level around 700 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "There is a general covering of new snow above 650 metres, with areas of windslab building in wind sheltered locations although currently not extensive. Terrain most affected are coire rims, ridge flanks and in gullies, on steep North-East through East to South aspects, mostly above 750 metres. Elsewhere, new snow deposits are shallow and windward aspects are scoured at higher elevations. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Where exposed the old snowpack is very firm and icy.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "North-Westerly winds will ease and veer to become Northerly overnight and through the day. After a few showers overnight it will be a dry day. The freezing level will be around 800 metres.",

However, areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain in wind sheltered locations on mainly North-East through East to South aspects above 900 metres.  Fragile cornices will exist above these aspects. On exposed windward aspects the snowpack will be very shallow, and stability will be better.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

New snow and wind transport of existing snow has formed unstable windslab in sheltered areas.

The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

The greatest depths are mostly in steep wind sheltered locations, such as convexities, coire rims and gully tops. Outwith these areas, the older snowpack is firm and refrozen while a dusting was present above 800 metres at midday. Fresh cornices developed as the day progressed.
