        "comment": "In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as above the tree line precarious wind slabs formed. The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant above the tree line. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence. The danger of moist small and medium sized avalanches will increase during the day."

Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as in places that are protected from the wind. Moist and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, in particular on steep slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as at the base of rock walls above the tree line. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/>"
