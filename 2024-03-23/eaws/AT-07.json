Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, as well as adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects at elevated altitudes. Mostly avalanches are only small but can be released even by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> A latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can reach medium size. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> <br/> In addition as the day progresses some small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized loose snow avalanches are possible. In the event of prolonged bright spells this applies on extremely steep sunny slopes.",
