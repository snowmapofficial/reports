The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs that are forming during the snowfall will be deposited on a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line. Especially here avalanches can be triggered in the faceted old snow and reach medium size. With the onset of the intense snowfall, the natural avalanche activity will increase. Especially in places where the wind is stronger the avalanche danger is greater. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 10 cm of snow has fallen since Saturday. 15 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1500 m. As a consequence of a gusty wind from southerly directions, soft wind slabs will form. These will be deposited on a weakly bonded old snowpack above the tree line. The old snowpack is faceted and weak; its surface consists of faceted crystals. This applies especially in shady places that are protected from the wind. The old snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The new snow and wind slabs remain prone to triggering.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2026-01-25T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-01-26T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-01-25"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":["DP5","DP6"]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"earlier","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","N","E"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"later","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"many","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","N","E"]}],"bulletinID":"6f588c4a-2e14-4acb-866d-9af9a27995a2","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"earlier"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"earlier"},{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"later"},{"mainValue":"considerable","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"later"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Latemar","regionID":"IT-32-TN-09"},{"name":"Southern Adamello","regionID":"IT-32-TN-02"},{"name":"Primiero - Pale di S.
