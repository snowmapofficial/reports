        "WeatherInfluences": "Strong East South Easterly airflow will continue. Snow showers throughout the period. Remaining cold.",
        "SnowStability": "Weak windslab will become deeper and more extensive on all steep South West through North to North East aspects above 950m. Weak cornices will continue to build over all the above locations. Much better stability on all ridges and windward aspects where firm or crusty snow ice is widespread above 850m.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Good stability in all wind exposed locations where hard or crusty conditions prevail. However, snow continued to drift even in the absence of snowfall and weak windslab was beginning to gain depth on steep South West to North aspects above 950m. Cross loading has affected the top of selected steep North East facing gullies above the same altitude. Some minor weak cornice development noted high above steeper lee slopes.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

Greatest accumulations will be on West to North aspects above 1000 metres with more localised deposits on South-West and North-East aspects and at lower elevations. Due to variable nature of recent winds isolated pockets of windslab possible on any aspect. Fragile cornices will continue to build. The older snowpack will be well bonded and stable.

Blizzard and whiteout conditions presenting challenging and serious conditions. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph.",

Cornices will present an ongoing threat of collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
