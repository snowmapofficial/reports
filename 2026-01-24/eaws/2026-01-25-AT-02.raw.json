The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs that are forming during the snowfall will be deposited on a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. Especially here avalanches can be triggered in the faceted old snow and reach medium size. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in places that are protected from the wind. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Individual natural avalanches are not ruled out."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 5 cm of snow has fallen since Saturday. 10 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1500 m.
