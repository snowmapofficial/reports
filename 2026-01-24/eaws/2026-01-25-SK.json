With the exception of isolated slopes, especially N and NW exposures, generally a favourable avalanche situation prevails. Avalanche release is possible on very steep slopes where snow slabs and pillows are deposited, especially with high additional loads. Avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow are possible at altitudes up to 1600 m above sea level.",
