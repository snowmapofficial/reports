Winds will be Strong mostly Easterly but occasionally East-South-Easterly.\nObserved Weather Influences: Overnight and this morning scattered precipitation which fell as light snow mainly above 750 metres with rain and milder conditions at lower elevations. The freezing level was around 800 metres. Winds were variable but mostly East-South-Easterly with another morning of poor visibility.\nObservedSnowStability: Further deposits of moderately bonded windslab are present in wind sheltered areas such as gully tops and coire rims. West through North to North-Easterly aspects above 900 metres are most affected. Cornices are fragile on same aspects. Elsewhere the snowpack stability is generally good. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
