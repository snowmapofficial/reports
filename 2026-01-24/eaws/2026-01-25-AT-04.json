        "comment": "The avalanche risk has hardly changed and remains moderate in some areas above the tree line. There are still avalanche prone locations adjacent to ridgelines, at terrain transitions and in bowls and gullies in the steep terrain, especially in the high-altitude northern and eastern sectors. Triggering of slab avalanches is possible in some places even under slight additional load. Small-scale avalanches, mainly caused by the recent southerly winds at higher altitudes, should be avoided.",

        "comment": "The snowpack is weakened by faceted crystals and/or floating snow, especially at higher altitudes. This means that slab avalanches can easily be triggered here. Depending on the aspect and hardness, the snowpack varies in hardness on the surface, sometimes icy. Mostly at higher altitudes, there may still be small-scale, disruptive drifts. In general, there is little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."
