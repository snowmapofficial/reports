        "comment": "Up to 1800 m rain will fall until Friday. A lot of new snow at high altitude. <br/> As a consequence of the precipitation more dry and moist avalanches are possible, but they can be large, especially on very steep slopes, and at the base of rock walls and at high altitude, in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation in particular. In the typical avalanche paths here the avalanches can in isolated cases reach the bare valleys. <br/> As the snowfall level drops only isolated ground avalanches are possible. <br/> The conditions are critical for backcountry touring. The fresh snow and the wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above approximately 1900 m. At high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent."
