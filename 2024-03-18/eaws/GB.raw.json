        "Summary": "GC19/3 Wet PM cooler+dry by day, wet snow instabilities overnight stabilising by morning, cornices liable to collapse Av hazard Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "The snowpack is generally moist at all levels. Very little snow below 750m.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells developing later.  Winds approx 10 - 20 mph fresh.",
        "Comment": "Wet conditions through the night will develop wet snow instabilities on the steepest slopes and corniced areas. Dry and cooler conditions by morning will bring a general improvement. Only a trace of new snow is expected. Cornices will remain suspect.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Wet, mild and windy conditions will affect all levels overnight. It will become cooler, less windy and mainly dry by dawn. Day time freezing levels will start at around 1200 metres before lowering to 950 metres through the course of the day. Winds will generally be Westerly, strong to gale force early in the day, decreasing to moderate later. A trace of new snow may affect the highest slopes but amounts are not expected to be significant.",
        "SnowStability": "Wet conditions overnight will saturate and further reduce the snowpack. There will be a return to cooler and dry conditions by morning. Overnight, wet snow instabilities will exist in corniced areas and on the steepest slopes and gullies. There will be a general stability improvement by dawn as cooler, dry conditions return but any remaining cornices should be treated with great caution.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light rain affected the area overnight. Today has been dry and slightly cooler with summit temperatures around plus 1-2 Celsius. Winds have been fresh, generally Southerly to South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is slowly thawing at all elevations but remains generally well bonded and stable in most locations. Greatest remaining snow accumulations are on North to Easterly aspects, mostly above 850 metres. Patchy snow cover exists below this elevation. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Some limited wet surface instability is possible overnight on steeper North to East aspects above 950 metres. Some potential for minor cornice collapse at this time too.
