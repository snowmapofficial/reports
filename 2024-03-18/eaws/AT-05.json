Apart from that, at high/high-alpine altitudes, snowdrifts can trigger as small-to-medium slab avalanches, both near to and distant from ridgelinees, behind discontinuities and in gullies. Most danger zones occurred on NW/N/E facing steep slopes. Above 2400 m on shady slopes there are still weak layers which can be triggered by large additional loading, releases occasionally grow to large size.",

At intermediate altitudes, rainfall. At high-alpine altitudes the base consists of settled fresh snow, dry on shady slopes. At high altitudes the W/NW winds have generated fresh snowdrifts. Beneath the latest fresh snowfall are melt-freeze crusts with which the fresh snow bonds poorly. Weak layer for slab avalanches: above 2400 m, blanketed fresh snow and faceted crystals near crusts, and graupel. Below 2000 m the snowpack has repeatedly become thoroughly moist.
