Avalanche prone locations are located adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit in steep terrain in northern and eastern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The number and extent of avalanche prone locations increase with altitude. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account.",
