Above around 2200 m, snow slabs can be triggered in some places by slight additional load in the wind slab and occasionally become medium sized. Danger areas due to wind slabs increase with altitude and are located adjacent to the ridgeline, but also distant from ridgelines behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. In some cases, they are covered by a few centimetres of soft new fallen snow and are not clearly visible. In shady slopes at high altitudes, there are also isolated trigger points for small to medium-sized slab avalanches in persistent weak layers that are difficult to disturb.",

Below this are layers of faceted crystals and melt-freeze crusts. Due to the heavily built-up transformed snow cover, the fracture propagation potential is generally low.
