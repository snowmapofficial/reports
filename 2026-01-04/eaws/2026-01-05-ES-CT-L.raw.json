Dry and moist snow slides are possible.","comment":"The sometimes new snow-covered wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep east, north and west facing slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. They are sometimes deep. Dry avalanches can additionally in some places be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation small dry and moist snow slides are possible. On very steep grassy slopes and on shady slopes individual gliding avalanches are possible."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady slopes, areas where the snow cover is rather shallow: Large-grained weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> Sunday: 2 to 5 cm of snow has fallen. Monday: The weather will be mostly sunny over a wide area. Until Wednesday the weather will be cold. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The avalanche danger will decrease gradually.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2026-01-05T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-01-06T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-01-05"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"fair","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","E","N"]}],"bulletinID":"9b07691c-9360-4920-80bd-21d8fe2d6f5c","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
