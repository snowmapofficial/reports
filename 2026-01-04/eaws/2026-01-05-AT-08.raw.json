Danger zones are located mostly near ridgelines on shady W-N-E facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. The frequency and spread of the avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. In addition, in high alpine regions avalanches can be triggered in isolated cases in the weak snow on very steep shady slopes. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall in outlying terrain also require defensive conduct."

The snowdrift accumulations were deposited primarily on shady slopes on top of an unfavorable old snowpack surface and are prone to triggering. In those places the old snowpack at high altitudes was often expansively metamorphosed and, therefore, weak. Elsewhere the old snowpack surface was generally melt-freeze encrusted, at lower altitudes often hard-frozen. Snow depths at all altitudes continue to be significantly below-average.
