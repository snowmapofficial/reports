Above around 2200 m, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by slight additional load in the wind slab and can occasionally be medium in size. Danger areas due to wind slabs increase with altitude and are located adjacent to the ridgeline, but also distant from ridgelines behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. In some cases, they are covered by a few centimetres of soft new fallen snow and are not clearly visible. In shady slopes at high altitudes, there are also isolated trigger points for small to medium-sized slab avalanches in persistent weak layers that are difficult to disturb.",

Some of these cover older drift snow packs or form fresh, brittle snowdrift accumulations on the otherwise crusted can form snow surface. Prone to triggering, weak layers of soft layers are most likely to be found in the drift snow packs and at the transition to the melt-freeze crust. Below this is a sequence of faceted crystals and melt-freeze crusts, but the potential for fracture propagation is generally low due to the heavily built-up, transformed snow cover. In isolated places, however, a prone-to-triggering combination of weak layer and snow slab cannot be ruled out."
