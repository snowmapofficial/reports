Avalanche prone locations are located adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit in steep terrain in northern and eastern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The number and extent of avalanche prone locations increase with altitude. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account."

Snowdrift accumulations and obstacles are often covered by a thin layer of soft new fallen snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. Below the old melt-freeze crust, faceted crystals can often be found right down to the ground, especially at higher altitudes. The snow depths are below average."
