        "comment": "The sometimes new snow-covered wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep east, north and west facing slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. They are sometimes deep. Dry avalanches can additionally in some places be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation small dry and moist snow slides are possible. On very steep grassy slopes and on shady slopes individual gliding avalanches are possible.",
        "highlights": "Weak layers in the old snowpack represent the main danger. Dry and moist snow slides are possible."
