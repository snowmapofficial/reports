The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in extremely steep terrain and in steep rocky terrain. In the valleys bordering the Esera basin and the Ribagor√ßana basin and at high altitude the avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

      "comment" : "5 to 10 cm of snow will fall until the evening in all altitude zones. The wind will be light. The new snow will be deposited on a crust in all aspects and in all altitude zones. <br/> The old snowpack is well consolidated. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 50 to 60 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
