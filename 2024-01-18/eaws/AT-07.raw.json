The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls in all aspects, but in isolated cases also adjacent to ridgelines. Avalanches are medium-sized. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> Low and intermediate altitudes: Individual moist loose snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> In addition further individual gliding avalanches are possible, in particular on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m.

As a consequence of new snow and a strong wind from westerly directions, further wind slabs formed in the last few days in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The sometimes new snow-covered wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. They are rather small but prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is largely stable. Snow depths vary greatly above the tree line, depending on the infuence of the wind. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. The rain gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack in particular at low and intermediate altitudes."
