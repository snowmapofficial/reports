Small-to-medium sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. Older danger zones have been blanketed and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry sports require much experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. Despite lower temperatures, glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
