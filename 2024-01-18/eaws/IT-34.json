        "comment": "Over a wide area 10 to 15 cm of snow has fallen above approximately 1600 m. As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, wind slabs will form in particular in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> At high altitude the wind slabs are larger. <br/> Fresh wind slabs are to be assessed with care and prudence. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. <br/> Over a wide area 10 to 20 cm of snow will fall on Friday above approximately 1500 m. The new snow of the last two days can be released easily or naturally in all aspects.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger."
