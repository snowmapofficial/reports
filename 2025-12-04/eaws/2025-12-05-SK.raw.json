Dangerous can be places where the slope changes abruptly, in narrow moguls, troughs and under rock walls. In the northern sector, the powdery nature of the snow still persists, lying on older hard ground. Great care should be taken in places where the powder surface changes to a windblown slab.",

It is between these two layers that there was a large difference in hardness and therefore an interface along which avalanches can be triggered. In the north, in shady locations and where there was less wind influence, the snow is powdery. The total snow depth in our mountains is 10-120 cm."
