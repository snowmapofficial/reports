        "Summary": "LO for 05.12 Windslab problem above 1100m on NW through N to NE aspects. Avalanche hazard will be moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow below 1100m, drifting above.  Whiteout conditions presenting challenging navigation and serious travel conditions above 900m.  Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "A lot of fresh snow overnight. Snow level around 950m, damp snow up to 1100m, dry drifting snow above. Very wintry on the tops. Expect more of the same tomorrow with much stronger winds.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Gale force South-Easterly winds increasing to Storm force during the afternoon. Frequent showers falling as snow on the highest tops. The freezing level is expected to be around 1050 meters.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh deposits of moderately bonded windslab will continue to accumulate on North-West through North to East aspects above 1100 meters. These instabilities are expected to be localised affecting wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and corrie headwalls. Cornices will continue to develop above these aspects. On other aspects and at lower elevations, the snowpack will remain generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Strong South-Easterly winds. Light showers falling as snow on summit plateau. The freezing level was around 1100 meters.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh deposits of moderately bonded windslab are present on North-West through North to East aspects above 1100 meters. These instabilities are localised affecting wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and corrie headwalls. Fragile cornices continued to build on these same aspects. On other aspects and at lower elevations, the snowpack is generally stable. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Summary": "NC for 5/12/25: Shallow avoidable windslab on NW to N aspects above 1100m.Elsewhere good stability. Low Hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Compact snow and ice on exposed windward slopes above 1100 metres.  Below this height, a soft snowpack is present. Cloud base around 900 metres all day. Summit winds around 30 - 40 mph easing through the day.",
        "Comment": "Good cover remaining above 1000 metres.  Fresh snowfall accumulations not expected to be significant.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Summit snow showers overnight will clear to leave a dry day.  Very strong South-South-East winds increasing during the afternoon.  The freezing level will around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Shallow accumulations of fresh windslab will build on North-West to North aspects above 1100 metres.  These will be localised in nature and easily avoidable with gully tops and coire rims mainly affected.  Elsewhere the existing snowpack will have good stability in all locations.  Snow loss will continue at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry day with some afternoon snow showers above 1100 metres.  Winds were very strong from the South-East easing through the day.  The freezing level was around 1100 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack is stable in all locations.  Below 1100 metres, the snowpack is soft in nature and continues to slowly thaw.  Greatest amounts of snow can be found above 900 metres, especially in high North facing coires and high plateaus.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
