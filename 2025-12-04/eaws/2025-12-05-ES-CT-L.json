        "comment": "The fresh snow and in particular all the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects and generally above the tree line. Dry avalanches can in many cases be released very easily or triggered naturally. Sometimes they are medium-sized. Wind-loaded slopes where hard layers are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack are especially dangerous. They are to be avoided in very steep terrain. <br/> <br/> Off-piste activities call for caution and restraint. The avalanche prone locations are quite prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",

They will become increasingly prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
