In addition, small-sized masses of fresh fallen snow and snowdrifts occur in ridgeline and pass zones and behind protruberances in the landscape at increasing frequency with ascending altitude. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. These avalanche prone locations are easily recognized for practiced mountaineers. Especially on smooth-ground sunny slopes, small-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible."

With increasing altitude, particularly in ridgeline and pass zones, as well as behind protruberances in the landscape, small-sized freshly generated and older snowdrift accumulations occur which are prone to triggering. At higher altitudes, particularly on shady slopes, faceted intermediate layers occur inside the snowpack. In places, these can be triggered. There is still only limited information available to the Avalanche Warning Services from off-piste terrain."
