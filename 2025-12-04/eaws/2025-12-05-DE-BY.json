        "comment": "The avalanche risk is low. Small accumulations of drift snow on steep slopes close to the crest with exposures from south-west to north to east and in gullies and hollows can be problematic, especially at high altitudes. In places, they can be triggered as small slab avalanches with a small additional load.\n\nSmall, spontaneous sliding snow avalanches are also possible below 2200 metres. Very steep slopes with slippery ground such as very steep meadows, forest aisles and rock slabs are affected. Avoid areas below sliding snow cracks.",

It is mainly deposited on the shady side on an angularly built-up old snow surface or surface hoar frost. On shaded slopes at higher altitudes, layers of angular crystals are sometimes preserved deeper in the old snow. At the transition to the ground, the snowpack is often wet below 2200 metres."
