In addition, small-sized masses of fresh fallen snow and snowdrifts occur in ridgeline and pass zones and behind protruberances in the landscape at increasing frequency with ascending altitude. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. These avalanche prone locations are easily recognized for practiced mountaineers. Especially on smooth-ground sunny slopes, small-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible.",
