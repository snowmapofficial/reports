      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is moderate above 2400 metres and low below that. The main problem is slab avalanches in old snow, which can still be triggered by individual winter sports enthusiasts in the west, north and east exposures, especially at transitions from a little to a lot of snow. In addition, drift snow packs can still be triggered in the extended northern sector. Danger spots are located here particularly in the entrance areas of gullies and hollows as well as behind terrain edges. The avalanches usually remain small, but can occasionally break through into the old snow and become medium-sized.\nBelow 2800 m, small gliding snow avalanches can still spontaneously occur. Avoid areas underneath sliding snow pockets."

      "comment" : "A total of between 5 and 10 centimetres of fresh snow will fall overnight and on Friday with little wind influence. On the shady side, the fresh snow may cover fresh (from the south foehn of the past few days) and older drift snow packs, which are lying on an unfavourably built-up old snow cover of angular crystals. In areas where the wind has calmed down, the old snow surface is still loose or covered with surface frost. On the sunny side, the old snow cover is set far up and can be hardened. In very steep grass mat terrain, the snow cover is partly sliding off the ground."
