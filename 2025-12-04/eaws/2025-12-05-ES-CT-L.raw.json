Dry avalanches can in many cases be released very easily or triggered naturally. Sometimes they are medium-sized. Wind-loaded slopes where hard layers are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack are especially dangerous. They are to be avoided in very steep terrain. <br/> <br/> Off-piste activities call for caution and restraint. The avalanche prone locations are quite prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"15 to 20 cm of snow will fall until the early morning. The wind will be strong to storm force in particular in the east and in the south. The northwesterly wind will transport the new snow significantly. The fresh snow and the wind slabs will be deposited on soft layers in all aspects. They will become increasingly prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Evening and night: Gradual decrease in danger of dry avalanches as the snowfall eases.
