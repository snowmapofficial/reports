The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in west to north to east facing aspects above approximately 2400 m. The mostly small wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."

Somewhat older wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack especially on steep shady slopes. The high temperatures gave rise to moistening of the snowpack at intermediate altitudes."
