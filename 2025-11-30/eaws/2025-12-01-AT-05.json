In the sectors from west to north to east, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by even a small additional load. Avalanches can tear through to deeper weak layers and become medium sized if the snow is thick enough.\nSmall slab avalanches can also be triggered in fresh drift snow, especially in west, north and east exposures above 2200 metres. The few danger spots are located close to the main ridge. Below 2800 m, mainly small sliding snow avalanches can occur spontaneously.",
