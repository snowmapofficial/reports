        "comment": "The wind slabs of last week are poorly bonded with the old snowpack. Weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack can be released by people especially on steep, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds have confirmed the existence of a weak snowack on shady slopes. <br/> As a consequence of the new snow individual snow slides are possible above approximately 1500 m.",
        "highlights": "Weakly bonded old snow requires caution. Moist snow slides are to be expected from the early morning."
