        "comment": "The avalanche risk is low. At medium altitudes, sliding snow is the main problem. On very steep, smooth ground, for example on meadows, in forest aisles and on rock slabs, individual small sliding snow avalanches can detach themselves. There is a particular danger where sliding snow cracks have already opened and the slopes have not yet unloaded.\n\nAt higher altitudes, isolated weak layers in old snow can be problematic. Slab avalanches can be triggered in particular with large additional loads, especially on very steep, shady slopes at the transition from little to much snow. Avalanches usually remain small, but the risk of falling must be taken into account.",
        "highlights": "Some of the obstacles are only lightly covered with snow, note the risk of falling and injury!"
