The danger is concentrated in places where there are hard blown slabs. Smooth grassy slopes and very steep slopes above 35° are particularly dangerous. There is still powder snow in the north and in shady locations.  Below the upper forest line and at lower altitudes there is significantly less snow, so the situation is more stable there.",

It is between these two layers that there was a large difference in hardness and therefore an interface along which avalanches can be triggered. In the north, in shady locations and where there was less wind influence, the snow is powdery. The total snow depth in our mountains is 10-120 cm."
