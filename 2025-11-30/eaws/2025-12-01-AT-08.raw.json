Small-sized snowdrift accumulations can be triggered with increasing frequency at ascending altitudes. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggerred by winter sports enthusiasts. Especially on steep grass-covered slopes, small-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible. Be careful beneath glide cracks."

The fresh fallen snow and small-sized snowdrift accumulations from the last few days are settling increasingly and firming up. At heightened altitudes they were often deposited on top of faceted layers of old snow from late autumn. The bonding is poor in places."
