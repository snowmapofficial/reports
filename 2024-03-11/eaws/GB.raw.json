        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions are expected throughout the forecast period.  Fresh South-South-Easterly winds will increase to gale force during the morning. The 1000 metre freezing level will steadily rise to above the summits during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of unstable windslab will persist on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.  Areas most affected will be in steep, locations such as coire rims, gully tops, crag aprons and convexities.  Cornices will overhang these aspects. During the day the snowpack will slowly begin to consolidate. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "No snow below 650m and mostly bare on the coastal ranges. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 10-20 mph giving a significant windchill.",
        "Comment": "Diminishing snowpack, but significant areas of snow remain above 800m on the inland mountains. The snowpack will start to surface soften through the day, but will remain generally firm, particularly at summit levels.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A small amount of summit sleet and snow will fizzle out this evening, turning largely dry overnight. Some light rain and drizzle at all levels is expected from late morning onwards as the freezing level rises well above the summits by daybreak. A strengthening, generally South-East wind will become fresh to strong by midday.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected to the snowpack which will remain firm and stable throughout. However, some surface softening of the snow is likely through the day. Most snow will exist on the more inland mountains on high North to East aspects, particularly around coire rims, in gully lines and on some summit slopes. Coastal ranges will largely be bare. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "Comment": "A generally favourable situation with some summit snow expected due to the passage of a weak front.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light precipitation is expected overnight and through the morning. Overnight, this will fall as snow above 1100 metres before transitioning to light rain at all levels by dawn. Winds will be mostly South-Easterly, fresh increasing to very strong by midday. The freezing level will be around 1200 metres overnight, rising to lie above the summits by dawn.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will be generally well bonded, stable and is expected to soften as the day progresses. Isolated areas of windslab will be deposited in wind sheltered locations on West through North to North-East aspects above 1100 metres. Areas most affected will be steep gully tops and scarp slopes. These deposits are expected to be shallow and avoidable. Cornices will become weak later. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A generally dry day with fresh, decreasing to moderate South-Easterly winds. The snow surface remained sub zero above 800 metres due to a stable airmass.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is stable, firm and icy in most locations. A breakable crust was also present above 1000 metres, with thick rime deposits in plateau areas. Isolated deposits of wind blown snow are present in some wind sheltered locations, particularly in hollows and stream beds, presenting little in the way of hazard. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

The freezing level will be around 1100 metres overnight rising above all summits from early morning. Fresh mainly South-Easterly winds overnight will increase to strong during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Snowpack stability will remain good in most locations. Isolated, windslab deposits continuing to develop overnight on West to North aspects above 1000 metres. Deposits are expected to be shallow, easily avoidable and will mostly affect summit gullies and steep slope tops. Minor wet snow surface instability possible in the same locations as rain develops in the afternoon. Cornices will weaken as the temperatures rise. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry, cloudy day with moderate South-Easterly winds. The freezing level was around 1000 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The older snowpack is stable in all locations. The snow surface is firm and icy in some wind exposed locations with a breakable crust elsewhere. A thin covering of largely insignificant snow fell overnight with slightly deeper deposits of moderately bonded windslab on West and North-West aspects above 1000 metres. These deposits are generally shallow and avoidable and are consolidating quickly. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
