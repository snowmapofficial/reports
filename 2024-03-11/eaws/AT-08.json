A small-to-medium slab and in steep terrain also loose-snow avalanche can be triggered by 1 person.  Such danger zones will increase with ascending altitude, can often be covered. Snowdrift masses in steep terrain should be avoided. In backcountry terrain, a cautious route selection is imperative. On very steep and rocky slopes, slides and loose-snow avalanches can be expected during the course of the day due to solar radiation. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger at any time of day or night and grow to medium size in zones where snowfall has been heavy. Caution below glide-cracks.",
