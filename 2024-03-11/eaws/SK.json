        "comment": "The weather during Tuesday will be influenced by a frontal boundary and a pressure low advancing from the southeast. The latter will bring precipitation, which will be rainy up to 1700 m above sea level. In the High, Western and Western part of the Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger, i.e. the second degree of the 5-part international scale. At the highest altitudes, the main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow, especially in the N, NW, NE and W orientations. Thus, in the gullies of the highest altitudes with a high slope, situated on the leeward sides of the ridges, it is possible to find wind-rolled slabs and pillows of unstable snow, which can be loosened, especially by large additional loads. At mid-elevations, rain reduces stability by intensively soaking the snow cover, so the second avalanche problem is wet snow. Avalanches from wet snow or foundation avalanches from wet snow can occur, especially on slopes with visible crevasses.",

Dry snow is only found at the highest elevations of the mountains and has been transported by the wind to the leeward sides of the mountains in slabs and pillows. Such formations lie on a layer of old firn with which they are not sufficiently bound."

The weather during Tuesday will be influenced by a frontal boundary and a pressure low advancing from the southeast. The latter will bring precipitation, which will be rainy up to 1700 m above sea level.  Rain and warm weather will continue to reduce stability by intensively drenching the snow cover, so wet snow and slippery snow are the main avalanche problems. Wet snow avalanches or foundation avalanches from wet snow may occur, especially on slopes with visible gullies.
