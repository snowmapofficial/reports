With the end of the intense precipitation, the natural activity of wet avalanches will decrease. <br/> Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects below approximately 2500 m. On very steep shady slopes the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size. <br/> <br/> In high Alpine regions medium-sized moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected. In the event of prolonged bright spells this applies in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes."
