      "comment" : "There is a MODERATE avalanche danger in the high altitudes of the Western and High Tatras (above 1800 m asl), 2nd degree. Due to rain and warming, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, troughs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes where a larger amount of snow is concentrated are dangerous. Avalanches can be triggered here, especially with higher additional loads, but spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow can also occur. Care should also be taken on the cornices in the upper parts of the ridges. On isolated steep slopes with grassy subsoils, gliding (base) avalanches may also occur.",
