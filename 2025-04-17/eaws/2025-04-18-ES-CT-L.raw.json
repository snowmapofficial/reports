The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones and on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m. The danger of natural moist avalanches will increase significantly during the day. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and wind from northerly directions, visible wind slabs formed. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized and easily released. As a consequence of a light to moderate southwesterly wind, mostly small wind slabs will form in the course of the day. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in shady places that are protected from the wind. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended."
