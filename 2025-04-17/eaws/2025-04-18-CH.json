With sometimes strong southeasterly winds, large snowdrift accumulations have formed at high altitudes. In those regions most exposed to precipitation, there have been numerous naturally triggered avalanches, some very large and advancing down into the valleys. Naturally triggered avalanches are still possible in these regions, especially overnight to Friday. These may start in the old snowpack, especially in high-altitude, shady slope catchment areas, and may become very large and advance down into the valleys. In the inneralpine regions of Grisons, where there has been only little fresh snow, weak layers in the old snowpack are still sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes in the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 2800 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to around 2400 m. At intermediate altitudes, the fresh snow fell widely on snowless ground. Gliding and wet avalanches are still to be expected  and may become large in those regions most exposed to precipitation.</p>"

With sometimes strong southeasterly winds, large snowdrift accumulations have formed at high altitudes. In those regions most exposed to precipitation, there have been numerous naturally triggered avalanches, some very large and advancing down into the valleys. Naturally triggered avalanches are still possible in these regions, especially overnight to Friday. These may start in the old snowpack, especially in high-altitude, shady slope catchment areas, and may become very large and advance down into the valleys. In the inneralpine regions of Grisons, where there has been only little fresh snow, weak layers in the old snowpack are still sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes in the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 2800 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to around 2400 m. At intermediate altitudes, the fresh snow fell widely on snowless ground.
