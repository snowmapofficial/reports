As the temperature drops there will be a decrease in the avalanche danger to level 2 (moderate) by the early morning. <br/> Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes below approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs formed above approximately 2600 m. The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases especially on very steep shady slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain.",

On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is now lying. As a consequence of falling temperatures the snowpack will consolidate during the course of the night. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: Over a wide area 20 to 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Wednesday. As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs formed in isolated cases. These are lying on soft layers on steep shady slopes. The weather effects will facilitate a rapid strengthening of the snow drift accumulations."
