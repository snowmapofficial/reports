Danger zones occur particularly on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and behind sudden drops in the terrain. The old snow can trigger avalanches particularly from large additional loading. The avalanche prone locations are not visible, especially on steep shady slopes. If a release sweeps along the entire snowpack with it, the avalanche can grow to medium size. Activities in backcountry demand careful evaluation of the terrain and the dangers as well as a large measure of restraint.",
