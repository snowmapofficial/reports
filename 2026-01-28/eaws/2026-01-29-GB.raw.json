        "SnowDistribution": "Good cover about about 700 metres, breakable crust makes for hard going in places.  Generally good visibility. Winds about 20mph.",
        "Comment": "Snowpack surface firm and icy in many locations.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Another settled day is expected. Generally dry for most of the period with a few snow showers during the afternoon. The freezing level will drop from 1000 metres overnight to 600 metres during the day. Winds from the South-East.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected in the snowpack. Some areas of moderately bonded windslab will be found on West to North aspects above 900 metres. There may be some shallow fresh deposits forming in these aspects during the afternoon. On other aspects, and below 900 metres, the snowpack will be well consolidated and generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A dry and settled day with a moderate South-Easterly breeze. The freezing level rose to around 900 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Yesterday\\'s storm packed significant amounts of dense windslab into sheltered locations on West to North aspects above 900 metres. This is generally reasonably well bonded. Some shallower, softer and less well bonded surface layers were noted in some locations on these aspects. On other aspects, and below 900 metres the snowpack has an icy crust, is well consolidated and is generally stable.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "A return to gale force South-Easterlies in prospect for Thursday. Active drifting will resume, augmenting windslab deposits in steep wind sheltered locations.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snowfall is expected overnight and throughout daylight hours, with the greatest amounts in the east of the Northern Cairngorms area. Winds will be generally from the South-East, strong overnight gradually increasing to gale force by the afternoon. The freezing level will be around 900 metres lowering to 600 metres later.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will be deposited on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres, where it will add to already deep accumulations. Coire headwalls, gullies and crag aprons will be affected. Large cornices will also be present above these aspects. Below 900 metres steep rollovers, convexities and steep banks will harbour lingering instabilities. Elsewhere, the snow will be subject to slow consolidation. Wind exposed slopes are firm. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A dry and bright day, following snowfall in the first part of the night. Winds were South-Easterly storm force overnight, fresh to strong during the day. A maximum gust of 130 mph was recorded at 1245 metres during the last reporting period. The freezing level was around 900 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Unstable windslab is present on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres, mostly in steep wind sheltered locations. Examples include gullies and coire headwalls, where large cornices have developed. At elevations below 900 metres, more localised moderately bonded windslab is present. This is mostly confined to steep rollovers, convexities and steep banks. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

Specific areas of unstable windslab will be present above 1000 metres in steep locations on mainly West through North to North-East aspects, gullies, gully tops, ridge flanks, and sheltered hollows most affected. Any cornices will be fragile. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

The snowpack at lower elevations has started to consolidate with stability improving.  Areas exposed to yesterday\\'s strong winds are scoured and generally frozen. Small cornices have formed on some steeper aspects. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",
