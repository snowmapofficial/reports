        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes moderate wind from westerly directions, extensive wind slabs formed in the course of the day especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. As a consequence of warming during the day moist snow slides and avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> All aspects: Gliding avalanches can be released at any time of day or night. In isolated cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
