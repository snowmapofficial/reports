      "comment" : "With ascending altitude, fresh snowdrifts are increasingly prone to triggering. One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches. Danger zones occur particularly on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and behind sudden drops in the terrain. The old snow can trigger avalanches particularly from large additional loading. The avalanche prone locations are not visible, especially on steep shady slopes. If a release sweeps along the entire snowpack with it, the avalanche can grow to medium size. Activities in backcountry demand careful evaluation of the terrain and the dangers as well as a large measure of restraint."

One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger small-sized, in isolated cases medium-sized slab avalanches. Other danger zones occur on extremely steep, mostly shady slopes. In isolated cases, small avalanches can be triggered in the old snow in those places. Such avalanche prone locations occur particularly in transitions from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution."

On south-facing slopes the fresh snow often fell on bare ground."
