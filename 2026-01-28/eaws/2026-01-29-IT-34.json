The new snow can be released by a single winter sport participant especially on west to north to south facing aspects above the tree line. Over a wide area 50 cm of snow, and up to 70 cm in some localities, will fall until the early morning above approximately 1800 m. In particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation numerous medium-sized and large dry avalanches are to be expected as the snowfall becomes more intense. The off-piste conditions are dangerous. Temporary safety measures may be necessary. Faceted weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. Is these aspects numerous medium-sized and large dry avalanches are possible. Avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow, even by a single winter sport participant. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack. The conditions are critical for backcountry touring outside marked and open pistes.",

Over a wide area up to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1500 m. Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large natural avalanches are possible. The fresh snow and the wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line. Especially here avalanches can be triggered in the faceted old snow. This applies even in case of a small load. The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable. In particular on steep slopes numerous medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of the new snow. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and natural avalanches serve as an alarm sign. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection. In particular in regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater.",
