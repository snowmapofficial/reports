        "comment": "There is a moderate avalanche danger at altitudes above 1800 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Dangerous are leeward sides of ridges, places under rock walls and narrow couloirs. Especially in these places there are locally inflated slabs and pillows, which are deposited on very hard ground. Their loosening is possible with large additional loads on very steep slopes. There is a risk of small, occasionally medium-sized slab avalanches, which pose a risk in conjunction with terrain traps.",
        "highlights": "Watch out for local snow slabs and pillows placed on hard ground."

        "comment": "During the last snowfall, up to 15 cm of new snow fell in the highest altitudes of the Tatras, which is deposited irregularly on the hard older ground. In northern and shady orientations there is loose powder snow. Tomorrow's warming will cause the snow cover to become wet to hard ground, especially in the W and SW orientations. Therefore, the occurrence of small drifts of mainly wet snow cannot be ruled out.  At lower and middle altitudes, the snow cover is already patchy."
