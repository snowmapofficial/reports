        "comment": "In some localities up to 10 cm of snow will fall above approximately 1500 m. As a consequence of the precipitation the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent in the afternoon. Slow warming. As the snowfall level rises gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible. In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as at high altitude large surface-area wind slabs will form. The fresh wind slabs can be released, especially by large additional loads,.",
