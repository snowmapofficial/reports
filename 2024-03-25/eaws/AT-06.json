Danger zones increase with ascending altitude, occur behind discontinuities and in gullies and bowls, also distant from ridges, slabs can be triggered by 1 person and can be medium-sized. \r\nOn sunny slopes, isolated small-to-medium naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches possible in steep rocky terrain.\r\nDanger of glide-snow avalanches rising in steep sunny grass-covered terrain at all altitudes.

        "comment": "The fresh fallen snow from the last 2 days (10-40 cm) is being deposited by southerly winds on leeward slopes as fresh snowdrift accumulations. Weak layers exist  (loose layers & faceted forms) in transitions to the snow base and drifts. Isolated more deeply embedded weak layers near crusts are evident on shady slopes in isolated cases.Due to radiation (also diffuse) and warmth the snowpack rapidly becomes moist and forfeits its firmness. Increasing moistness down to the ground leads to gliding activity of the entire snowpack."
