Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in positions above the forest zone - on very steep slopes on which new snow is deposited. This locally forms snow slabs and pillows.",

      "comment" : "In total, between 2 and 7 cm of new snow fell on the mountains during the two days of light snowfall. This is being transported to the leeward slopes, under saddles and rock walls at high altitudes. In these places, the height of the new snow is 10 to 15 cm, but this is a local matter. The new snow has not significantly changed the snow conditions or the avalanche situation. The snow cover is well below average for the time of year. Continuous snow cover (together with older snow) is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above approximately 1500 m). On the surface there is up to 8 cm of new snow on average, under which is mostly frozen firn, on the northern slopes crust. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made up of ice covered with newer snow."
