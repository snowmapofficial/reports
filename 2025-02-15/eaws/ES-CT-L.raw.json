They can be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can be released in the old snowpack in very isolated cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep, little used shady slopes. Avalanches are medium-sized."

The weather will be partly cloudy. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
