      "comment" : "The sometimes strong wind will transport the snow. The wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines. The fresh wind slabs can be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and at transitions into gullies and bowls. <br/> The new snow can be released naturally in all aspects above the tree line. In particular at the base of rock walls numerous small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are possible as a consequence of the new snow. <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack on northwest, north and northeast facing slopes. Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released by large additional loads on steep shady slopes. Especially on very steep shady slopes the avalanches can be released in deep layers of the snowpack and reach medium size."

These can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. <br/> In some places new snow is lying on a hard crust."
