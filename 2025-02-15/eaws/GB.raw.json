        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground. Good visibility.  Winds approx 10mph to 20mph.",
        "Comment": "Continuing to feel cold in higher wind exposed areas. Some paths at higher elevations remain icy in places.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be dry and cloudy throughout the period. Strong Easterly or South-Easterly winds will steadily decrease through the day becoming fresh to moderate. The overnight freezing level will be around 400 metres, rising to around 600 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The patchy snow cover will remain firm and stable in all locations. Greatest snow cover will be mostly in mountain areas inland from the coastal ranges and on Northerly to Easterly aspects above 750 metres. Snow will be mainly confined to coire rims, ridge flanks and gullies. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Fresh South-East winds will increase strong to gale force during the day and become South-South-Easterly in direction. Very little precipitation expected apart from a trace of snow during the morning.  The freezing level will be around 600 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will continue to develop on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Areas affected will be steep locations such as gullies, crag aprons and corrie rims. Below 900 metres and above 700 metres, these accumulations will be more isolated, affecting steep banks and burn lines. Fragile cornices will overhang some of these aspects. Elsewhere the snowpack will be firm and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

The greatest instability is within steep and convex wind sheltered locations such as corrie rims, gullies and crag aprons. Fragile cornices overhang some of these aspects.  Elsewhere the old snowpack is firm and stable and plateau areas mostly scoured.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
