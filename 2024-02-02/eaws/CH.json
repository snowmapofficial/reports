Strong winds will continue to blow at high altitudes in the days ahead, but there is hardly any more snow that can drift.</p><p>In the old snowpack near the surface, there are still isolated weak layers, which are prone to triggering, at above approximately 2500 m. The bottom section of the snowpack is generally stable.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible. This is mainly the case on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below around 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in regions with a lot of snow.</p>"
