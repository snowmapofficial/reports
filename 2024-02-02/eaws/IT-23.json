        "comment": "A mostly favourable avalanche situation will prevail. In the morning there is a risk of slipping on hard snow. It is advisable to bring a snow knife and crampon with you for the steeper sections. <br/> The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation gliding avalanches and wet snow slides are possible, in particular in case of releases originating from very steep sunny starting zones below approximately 2800 m that still retain some snow. <br/> As a consequence of a strong wind from northerly directions, small wind slabs formed on Friday at high altitude. This applies in particular along the border with Switzerland. <br/> Dry and wet avalanches can be released in near-surface layers, in particular by large additional loads. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep slopes. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",
        "highlights": "The backcountry touring conditions are mostly favourable. The snowpack will be in most cases stable."

Low and intermediate altitudes and sunny slopes: The conditions are spring-like. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing softening of the old snowpack. <br/> Below approximately 2200 m only a little snow is lying on south and southwest facing slopes. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Also adjacent to ridgelines hardly any snow is lying. <br/>"
