Avalanches tend to be small-sized. Wherever there is more than 20cm of fresh snow, avalanches can reach medium-size. On very steep shady slopes, weak layers can fracture and be swept along. On extremely steep slopes, small loose-snow avalanches can be expected. Isolated small naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible."

In places the surface hoar will be blanketed. Inside the old snowpack there are weak layers on very steep shady slopes: on the one hand the snow has expansively metamorphosed, particularly near ground level where the snow is shallow; on the other, below near-surface melt-freeze crusts, faceted crystals have formed. On shady wind-protected slopes there is still loose, dry snow to be found."
