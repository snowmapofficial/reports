        "SnowDistribution": "Little snow below 650m with accumulations gaining depth with altitude gain.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells during the afternoon.  Winds approx 10-20 mph.",
        "Comment": "Expect the redistribution of existing unconsolidated snow from mid mountain level through the forecast period.  Significant snowfall expected on Sunday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry day is expected with the exception of some light snowfall during the afternoon.  It will remain cold with the freezing level around 200 metres, rising to 400 metres in the afternoon.  Winds will be fresh from the South-South-East with a lull for a few hours in the early hours before backing East and becoming fresh once again.",
        "SnowStability": "Instabilities within the snowpack will persist on West and North-West aspects above 900 metres. Localised areas of unstable windslab will develop through the forecast period on mainly North aspects also above 900 metres. Areas most affected will be steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire rims.  Cornices will be found on West to North aspects. The old snow will be icy, hard with good stability. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A light dusting of fresh snow at all levels overnight cleared to leave a dry day with bright spells developing during the afternoon.  Winds were fresh from the South-East.  The freezing was at 200 meters at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Instabilities within the snowpack are present on West and North-West aspects above 900 metres. Areas most affected are coire rims, gully tops and other steep wind sheltered locations. Accumulations of fresh unstable windslab was identified on North and North-East aspects but these are shallow in nature and isolated. The old snow pack is firm with good stability. Cornices can be found on West through North to North-East aspects and remain a threat from collapse. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
