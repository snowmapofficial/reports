Avalanches tend to be small-sized. Wherever there is more than 20cm of fresh snow, avalanches can reach medium-size. On very steep shady slopes, weak layers can fracture and be swept along. On extremely steep slopes, small loose-snow avalanches can be expected. Isolated small naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
