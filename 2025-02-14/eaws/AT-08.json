Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude and occur particularly in steep shady terrain, but also behind protruberances in the landscape, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Avalanches can in places be triggered by one sole skier and reach medium size. Activities in backcountry demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers and defensive conduct. In addition, weak layers in the old snow can be triggered, particularly on steep shady slopes above 2200m, in transitions from shallow to deep snow and in zones where the snow is shallow. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is still difficult to assess. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
