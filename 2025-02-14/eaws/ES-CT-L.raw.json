They can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally,. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> The new snow remains in some cases prone to triggering. Small snow slides and avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> Below approximately 2400 m: In addition an appreciable danger of moist snow slides exists. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack are difficult to recognise. These can in very isolated cases be released by a single winter sport participant. Avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on little used shady slopes."
