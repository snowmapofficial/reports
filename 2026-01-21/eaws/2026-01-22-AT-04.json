Attention must still be paid to steep slopes adjacent to the ridgeline, transitions, terrain edges and steep bowls and gullies, especially in the northern and eastern sectors. Slab avalanches of up to medium size can still be triggered here in places even with low additional loads. Avoid small-scale fresh drifts caused by southerly winds, especially at higher elevations.",

In general, there is little snow and the snow cover, snowpack is very unevenly distributed. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."
