        "comment": "Wednesday: The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. In particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls sometimes large wind slabs formed. Thursday: As a consequence of new snow and a moderate wind from northerly directions, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day. Wind slabs can be released by people or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack on shady slopes. Especially transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released very easily. Sometimes the avalanches are dangerously large. <br/> <br/> The new snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. More dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation moist snow slides are possible in the afternoon. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience and great restraint.",
