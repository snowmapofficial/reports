        "SnowStability": "Initially, overnight high freezing levels, strong winds and driving rain will saturate the existing snowpack leading to wet snow instabilities on all steep slopes.

A slow thaw is diminishing the snow cover at lower levels but some icy footpaths and hillsides still persist.",
