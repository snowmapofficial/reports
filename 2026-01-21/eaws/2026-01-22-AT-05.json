Both fresh and older drift snowpacks as well as the weakly built-up old snowpack can be disturbed, whereby fractures can tear through. Avalanche prone locations are found in north-west, north to east facing steep terrain, but also in the south and west sectors and generally next to blown-off areas. They increase rapidly from the tree line upwards. Isolated remote triggering is still possible, drifting snow areas should be consistently avoided. Whumpfing collapsing sounds can indicate danger. Terrain traps are less full due to a lack of snow and are therefore more effective.",
