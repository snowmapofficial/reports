The avalanche prone locations are numerous. Avalanche prone locations are to be found also in areas close to the tree line. As the precipitation becomes more intense natural avalanches are to be expected. In particular on north and east facing slopes avalanches can be released in the various layers of new snow and reach large size. Additionally in very isolated cases avalanches can also penetrate deep layers and reach very large size. <br/> <br/> In addition a substantial danger of gliding avalanches exists. This applies on steep grassy slopes in all aspects in particular below approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks.",
