At the same time, the new snow is transported to the leeward troughs and moulds of mainly eastern orientation, where dangerous snow pillows and slabs are formed.\nMechanical release of avalanches is likely to be possible on very steep slopes with little additional loading.",

In particular, the warm front will bring precipitation and the cold front will bring cooling by midnight. Around 30cm of new snow is expected in the Fatras and the Western Tatras, around 20cm of new snow in the Low and High Tatras. The new snow falls on stable hard frozen ground and is transported initially by southwesterly, later northwesterly winds to the leeward slopes. The formation of dangerous snow pillows and slabs is expected in gullies and moguls."
