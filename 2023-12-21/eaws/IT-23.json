The wind will be strong to storm force over a wide area. <br/> Fresh wind slabs will form also areas not adjacent to ridgelines. Wind slabs can be released easily, especially on steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. At transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. <br/> Some medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are possible as a consequence of the strong northwesterly wind. <br/> From starting zones in which avalanches have already occurred in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanches can in isolated cases reach as far as the valley bottom. <br/> In the Mont Blanc area In the late morning in some localities danger level 4 (high) will be reached.",
