Where the soft layers are blanketed the fresh snow and drifts are prone to triggering. In addition, inside the fresh snow are weak layers near the surface. At intermediate altitudes the snowpack is moist down to the ground. Rain impact and the weight of the fresh snow is reactivating the weak layer problem: increasing gliding snow activity and glide-snow avalanches are the result."
