There is often still loose snow in the upper part of the old snowpack, which can be carried away by avalanches. Occasionally, avalanches can also release deeper in the snowpack in the area of older rain crusts due to the overload of the large amount of new fallen snow. This is particularly the case at altitudes between 2200 and 2600 m. Deeper snowpack layers are usually well compacted.</p><p>Some of the avalanche paths in the typical avalanche tracks have been erased by older avalanches. Avalanches can travel a long way in such avalanche tracks.</p>"
