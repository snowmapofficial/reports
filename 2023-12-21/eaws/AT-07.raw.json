      "comment" : "The fresh wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally,, especially on steep shady slopes in areas close to the tree line, as well as above the tree line. They can especially at their margins be released very easily. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Avalanches can reach medium size."

The fresh wind slabs are lying on soft layers at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. <br/> <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted. The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. <br/> <br/> Low and intermediate altitudes: Towards its base, the snowpack is moist."
