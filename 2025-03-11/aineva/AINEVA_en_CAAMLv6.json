In some localities 5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Wednesday above approximately 1800 m. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> The fresh snow and the wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. This applies especially at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example, as well as on very steep shady slopes. <br/> Several small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized dry and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, in the event of prolonged bright spells in particular on rocky sunny slopes. This applies in particular in particular below approximately 2600 m."

The new snow and wind slabs are lying on a crust on steep sunny slopes. <br/> In shady places that are protected from the wind: Towards its surface, the snowpack is dry and has a loosely bonded surface. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack on steep shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. <br/> In all aspects less snow than usual is lying. Adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas and at high altitude a little snow is lying. At low altitude less snow than usual is lying. On sunny slopes below approximately 2600 m hardly any snow is lying."
