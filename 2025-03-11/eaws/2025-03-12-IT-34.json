        "comment": "Over a wide area 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall on Wednesday above approximately 2000 m. Strong southwesterly wind above approximately 2000 m. Gradual increase in avalanche danger as a consequence of new snow and wind. Avalanches can occur easily or triggered naturally. This applies even in case of a small load. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects above approximately 2000 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls. Wind-loaded slopes where weaknesses exist in the old snowpack are unfavourable. At transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche situation is dangerous. Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large avalanches are possible. The snow sport conditions outside marked and open pistes are dangerous. Careful route selection and spacing between individuals are recommended.",

Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack here. <br/> On sunny slopes below approximately 2200 m hardly any snow is lying."
