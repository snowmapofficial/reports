In some localities 10 to 25 cm of snow will fall until Wednesday above approximately 1800 m. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> The fresh snow and the wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant. This applies especially at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example, as well as on very steep shady slopes. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. <br/> Several small and medium-sized dry and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, in the event of prolonged bright spells in particular on rocky sunny slopes. This applies in particular below approximately 2600 m. <br/> Gliding avalanches are possible. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
