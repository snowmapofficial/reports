      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong wind, easily released wind slabs formed in the last few days in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. Sometimes avalanches are large. Weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on steep shady slopes. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and fresh avalanches are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack. These avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the precipitation dry avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in steep terrain at intermediate and high altitudes and in places that are protected from the wind. In addition from midday in particular on southeast, south and southwest facing slopes, small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected. <br/>"

      "comment" : "In particular in the south 5 to 10 cm of snow fell in the early morning above approximately 1800 m. Up to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until the evening above approximately 1400 m. <br/> <br/> Over a wide area wind slabs are lying on old snow containing large grains. The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack. <br/> The solar radiation will give rise in the middle of the day to slight moistening of the snowpack in some cases in particular on steep sunny slopes."
