Light to moderate SW winds, brisker in foehn lanes."

Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow on the ground or atop smooth ground, increasingly frequent small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible."

On north-facing slopes at high altitudes, small-area, thin snowdrift accumulations atop soft layers could be prone to triggering."
