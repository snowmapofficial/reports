Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found on extremely steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Avalanches can reach medium size. <br/> As a consequence of wind from northwesterly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed in the last few days at elevated altitudes. This applies especially adjacent to ridgelines on very steep north and east facing slopes. They are mostly only small but can be released in isolated cases. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

These can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to gradual softening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
