They are lying on unfavourable layers in particular on very steep northeast, east and southeast facing slopes. The wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication. Caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. In particular transitions into gullies and bowls where weaknesses exist in the old snowpack are precarious. Single snow sport participants can release avalanches in some places, including medium-sized ones, caution is to be exercised in particular in the regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 3 (considerable). <br/> In some places avalanches can also penetrate deep layers and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are rather rare and are difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of solar radiation there will be an increase in the danger of dry and moist avalanches within the current danger level. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized natural avalanches are possible, in particular on very steep sunny slopes, and at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain."
