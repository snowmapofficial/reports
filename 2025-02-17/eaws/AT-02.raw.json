Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, releases can reach medium size. Due to northerly winds, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations were generated in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape. They can be triggered by one sole skier in the weak old snow, esp. on NW/N/E facing slopes above 2200m. Danger zones are generally small-sized and can be triggered in isolated cases, they increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration."
