Winds will be strong to very strong and predominately from the South-South-East. The freezing level will be around 400 metres, rising slightly by the end of the day.\nObserved Weather Influences: Unexpected light snow showers overnight above 300 metres were followed by a dry day. Consistently strong South-South-Easterly winds. The freezing level was around 400 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Unstable windslab is present in steep wind sheltered locations on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Accumulations continue to build with areas such as coire rims, gully tops and convexities mostly affected. Cornices remain fragile and prone to collapse. Elsewhere the snow is well bonded, either shallow, or forming isolated drifts at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
