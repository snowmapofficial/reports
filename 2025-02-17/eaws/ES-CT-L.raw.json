      "comment" : "The new snow of the last few days has bonded on shady slopes and at intermediate and high altitudes. Faceted weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on little used shady slopes. Fresh wind slabs will form adjacent to ridgelines on east, northeast and north facing slopes and generally at elevated altitudes. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases above approximately 2300 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. The avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones."

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from the middle of the day to moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> In some places wind slabs are lying on old snow containing large grains. In some cases the wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
