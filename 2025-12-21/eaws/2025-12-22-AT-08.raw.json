      "comment" : "No significant changes are anticipated, sunshine and high-altitude cloudbanks will provide pleasant mountain weather conditions. Temperatures will remain mild and southerly winds will be feelable only in the classic foehn lanes. Temperatures at 2000m: -1 to +4 degrees, at 3000m: -2 degrees. Light to moderate-velocity southerly winds at high altitudes, brisker in the foehn mountain ranges."

      "comment" : "In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in persistent weak layers on very steep shady slopes. These releases are mostly small-sized. In addition, generally small-sized snowdrift accumulations have been generated at very high altitudes. The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snowpack crust - breakable to capable-of-bearing-loads – which is generated during the nocturnal hours softens up during the daytime on sunny slopes, on shady slopes the snowpack surface often remains hard-frozen. Since there is hardly any transportable snow, strong-velocity southerly winds generated only small-sized local snowdrift accumulations. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
