The wind slabs are difficult even for the trained eye to recognise. In many cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> The new snow can be released very easily in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes. In many cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are small. <br/> In particular in the south and in the east the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for extensive experience and great restraint.",

As a consequence of the moderate to strong northerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes and at intermediate and high altitudes. These will become increasingly prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
