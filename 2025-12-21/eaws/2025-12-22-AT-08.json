Since there is hardly any transportable snow, strong-velocity southerly winds generated only small-sized local snowdrift accumulations. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services from outlying terrain."
