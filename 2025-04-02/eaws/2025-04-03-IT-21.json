They are lying on a crust in particular on steep sunny slopes and at low and intermediate altitudes. The soft wind slabs are easy to recognise and can be released by large loads in particular. <br/> The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to increasing consolidation of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes.
