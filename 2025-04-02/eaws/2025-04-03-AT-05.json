Above 2000m on north-facing slopes there are faceted crystals forming a weak layer in the lower part of the snowpack. Below 2000m the old snow is sticky or moist, after nights of cloudy skies it softens quickly during the morning hours and forfeits its bonding. Over ground which previously was bare of snow the fresh fallen snow can glide away as a glide-snow avalanche."
