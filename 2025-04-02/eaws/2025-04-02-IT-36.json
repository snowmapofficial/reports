        "comment": "The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In addition the easily released wind slabs must be taken into account. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes the avalanches can penetrate even deep layers and reach very large size in some cases. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. <br/> The avalanches can be released by small loads.",
