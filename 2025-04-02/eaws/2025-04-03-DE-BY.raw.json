Snowdrift accumulations are the major problem, esp. on sunny, extremely steep slopes where slab avalanches can trigger by large additional loading. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, releases can reach medium size.  On very steep grass-covered slopes, glide-snow avalanches can be expected, these can reach medium size in isolated cases. Due to solar radiation, small loose-snow slides can release naturally on extremely steep slopes."

During the daytime, mild temperatures up to high altitudes are making the snowpack moist, causing it to forfeit its firmness. Older snowdrift accumulations have consolidated somewhat. In many places graupel is embedded which can be prone to triggering. At intermediate altitudes the fresh fallen snow was frequently deposited on moist ground which was previously bare of snow."
