The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in northwest to north to east facing aspects above approximately 2300 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Some occasionally large avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> From the early morning as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist avalanches.
