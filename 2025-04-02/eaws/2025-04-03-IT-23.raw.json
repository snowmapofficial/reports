      "comment" : "Already in the early morning, a few, then as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more, and in some cases even large, natural avalanches are to be expected. Significant increase in avalanche danger especially on steep sunny slopes. <br/> Especially in the southern areas bordering Piedmont most affected by the rainfall. In these regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. Here the avalanches can be released naturally and can reach as far as intermediate altitudes. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a strong wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs formed on Wednesday in particular above approximately 2400 m. The fresh snow and in particular the wind slabs formed during the snowfall can be released easily in particular on steep shady slopes. They can be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes above approximately 2500 m."
