There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can\u00b4t be ruled out. In few places fresh snowdrift deposits which formed with the northerly winds are prone to triggering. This is considerable in terms of risk of falling. in sunny rocky terrain loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can\u00b4t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces.",

The old snow cove is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."

Clouds are passing through and unproductive snowfall is possible in the Northern Alps and Niedere Tauern. On Sunday morning remaining fog an louds are clearing up and it will be sunny. In the afternoon again clouds are forming but no precipitation is called. In the south it will stay dry and sunny. It will be too cool considering the season. Temperatures in 2.000 m at noon are around  -12 to -8 degrees and in 1.500 m -8 to -3 degrees. Due to the widchill effect of the strong velocity winds with gusts around 60 km/h the temperatures are experienced even cooler."
