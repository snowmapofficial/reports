From very steep grass-covered slopes below 2600m which have not yet discharged, isolated mostly small glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small moist loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day. Acute danger of falls on the hardened surfaces In general the danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow.",

On the surface on shady slopes, hoar or faceted crystals are generated potentially weak layers beneath the fresh snowdrifts. On very steep sunny slopes the small amount of snow is rapidly losing its bonding, even the melt-freeze crust is softening.

        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2200m is moderate. Slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading in some places, caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow. On very steep north-facing slopes above 2200m and on W/E-facing slopes above 2400m, avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and in isolated cases grow to large size. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small moist loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day. Due to strong-velocity northerly winds, small danger zones will be generated through fresh snowdrift patches which can be prone to triggering on very steep north-facing slopes (most are easy to recognize). From very steep grass-covered slopes below 2600m, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally.",
