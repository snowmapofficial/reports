        "comment": "In the high altitudes of the Western and High Tatras a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) has developed. Snowfall accompanied by extremely strong northerly winds creates dangerous snow slabs and pillows of varying thickness. Their distribution is very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Often under saddles, rock walls and in leeward troughs. In good weather such places are easily visible to experienced visitors. Avalanche release on steep slopes is possible, especially with high additional loads.",
        "highlights": "The danger is fresh, wind-drifted snow deposited in the form of wind slabs and pillows."
