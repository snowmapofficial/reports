There have also been some isolated avalanches on the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais. With northerly winds, small snowdrift accumulations will arise locally at higher altitudes.</p><p>With warmth and sunshine, the snowpack is becoming increasingly water-saturated. On southern slopes it is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2500 m. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, weak layers deeper in the snowpack are starting to become saturated for the first time. As a result, moist slab avalanches may occur spontaneously and may in places also be triggered by people.</p><p>Overnight to Sunday, a melt-freeze crust will form, which will be strong in places.

In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are still faceted layers deeper in the snowpack,  some of which are still prone to triggering, especially from the Davos region via Lower Engadine to Val M\u00fcstair, where a few avalanches have been triggered in the old snowpack over the last week. There have also been some isolated avalanches on the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais. With northerly winds, small snowdrift accumulations will arise locally at higher altitudes.</p><p>With warmth and sunshine, the snowpack is becoming increasingly water-saturated. On southern slopes it is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2500 m. In areas with a weak snowpack structure, weak layers deeper in the snowpack are starting to become saturated for the first time. As a result, moist slab avalanches may occur spontaneously and may in places also be triggered by people.</p><p>Overnight to Sunday, a melt-freeze crust will form, which will be strong in places. As daytime temperatures rise in the sunshine, this will soften rapidly as the day progresses and the risk of wet and gliding avalanches will increase.</p>"
