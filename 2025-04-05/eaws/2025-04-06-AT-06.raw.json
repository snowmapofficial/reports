      "comment" : "Saturday night polar airmasses are reaching the Eastern Alps with a northerly high streaming. Clouds are passing through and unproductive snowfall is possible in the Northern Alps and Niedere Tauern. On Sunday morning remaining fog an louds are clearing up and it will be sunny. In the afternoon again clouds are forming but no precipitation is called. In the south it will stay dry and sunny. It will be too cool considering the season. Temperatures in 2.000 m at noon are around  -12 to -8 degrees and in 1.500 m -8 to -3 degrees. Due to the widchill effect of the strong velocity winds with gusts around 60 km/h the temperatures are experienced even cooler."

      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is low. Danger spots are only in some places in shady steep areas in high altitudes. There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can´t be ruled out. In few places fresh snowdrift deposits which formed with the northerly winds are prone to triggering. This is considerable in terms of risk of falling. in sunny rocky terrain loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can´t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Due to the cooling and temperature drop the snow cover can stabilize and build hoar on the surface due to the influence of the winds. in Places thin snowdrift deposits are forming with the new snow which are poorly bondedWeak layers which are prone to triggering are only found in high altitudes on shady slopes within the old snow cover (Graupel, soft crystals). The old snow cove is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."
