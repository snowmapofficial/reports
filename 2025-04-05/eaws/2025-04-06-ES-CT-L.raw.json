Small to medium-sized natural avalanches are to be expected in all aspects. Moist avalanches can in some cases be released by a single winter sport participant. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected at any time. <br/> <br/> Old wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls."

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze very little and will already soften in the late morning. The spring-like weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> The old snowpack will be moist over a wide area. This applies on sunny slopes in all altitude zones, as well as on shady slopes below approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Weak layers exist in the centre of the old snowpack on shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended."
