        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs of the last three days can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. The sometimes deep wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on steep north, east and south facing slopes and generally at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Sometimes avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in all aspects above approximately 1500 m. These places are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection.",
