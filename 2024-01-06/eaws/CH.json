In addition, new snow, especially in the Prealps and the Jura, will be transported intensively by the sometimes strong Bise wind, forming snowdrift accumulations that are prone to triggering.</p><p>On the central part of the southern flank of the Alps and in southern Upper Engadine, the old snowpack structure has been partially transformed, especially in places with little snow, and fractures deeper in the snowpack are possible in isolated cases. In the other regions, the old snowpack structure is generally favourable. Hardly any fractures deeper in the snowpack are to be expected there.</p><p>Furthermore, some medium-sized and occasionally also large gliding avalanches are still possible, especially at altitudes between 2000 and 2500 m.</p>"
