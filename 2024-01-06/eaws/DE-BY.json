        "comment": "Avalanche danger will increase to considerable at high altitudes in the Bavarian Alps as the day unfolds. Main problem: snowdrift accumulations, being generated all day and highly prone to triggering. Danger zones occur esp. in steep ridgeline terrain on E/S/W facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Wherever the snow is bonded like a slab, caution is imperative. This is the case on many slopes at high altitudes. Slab avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person and reach medium size.\r\nThe often still loose fresh snow can trigger naturally as a loose-snow avalanche in extremely steep terrain, or also be triggered by persons. Apart from these risks, the dangers of falling are needful of consideration.\r\nIn addition, the danger of glide-snow avalanches is increasing somewhat, esp. on very steep slopes with a smooth ground beneath in all aspects - natural triggering is possible. Glide cracks are covered, thus, hard to spot. These releases can reach medium size.",
