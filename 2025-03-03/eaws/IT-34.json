        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach large size in isolated cases. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above the tree line. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Additionally in some places avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep west, north and east facing slopes and in little used terrain. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released. The danger of moist and wet avalanches will increase during the day. In the event of solar radiation this applies in particular."
