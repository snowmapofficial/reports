Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m, especially at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. <br/> The fresh wind slabs can in very isolated cases be released, but they will be small in most cases. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes, in isolated cases also adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Loose snow avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small."
