Slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier and reach medium size where snow is sufficient or if fractures down to more deeply embedded layers occur. Danger zones occur esp. on NW/N/E facing slopes, esp. near ridgelines and behind protruberances in the terrain and at entries into steep gullies and bowls. Danger zones often blanketed, making them difficult to recognize. Avalanches in the old snow above 2200m are isolated, possible only in extremely steep terrain on north-facing slopes. During the course of the day, naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches can be expected in all aspects, releases will be generally small-sized. On steep grass-covered slopes, very isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible."
