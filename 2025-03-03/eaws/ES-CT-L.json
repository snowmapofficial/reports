        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate southeasterly wind, easily released wind slabs formed in the last three days in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at intermediate and high altitudes. Released avalanches and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate this situation. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. These can be released easily or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. Especially on very steep slopes the avalanches can in some cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Moist snow slides as the day progresses."
