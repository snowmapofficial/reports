        "comment": "In the High, Western and Low Tatras above the forest border there is a moderate avalanche danger (level 2). In general, the snow from the last snowfall period (Thursday-Saturday) has melted and a layer of crust or firn has formed on its surface on the southern exposures due to temperature changes.\nOn the S facing slopes it is still possible to find places with dry untreated snow lying on a layer of ice or old hardened snow, between which there is a dangerous layer of square-grained snow. During Tuesday, the weather in the mountains of Slovakia will be influenced by a pressure high, which will bring clear weather.  On S-facing exposures, the snow cover will be progressively sun-soaked during the day.  Avalanches are expected to be released mainly on steep to very steep terrain, especially with high additional loads, especially on S slopes, where spontaneous avalanches and drifts of wet snow may also occur. Only small or medium avalanches are to be expected, but the problem is the transport and accumulation zone of the deposits, where, due to the low snow cover, there is often rock debris or exposed rock blocks.",
