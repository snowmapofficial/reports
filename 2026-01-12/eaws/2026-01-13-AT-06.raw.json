And so it is very sunny and dry for most of the day.\nThe temperature at an altitude of 2000 metres will be a mild 0 to +2 degrees.  A brisk wind from the west."

As a result of the warming, a bound snow layer will also develop in places where there was previously unbound powder. Weak layers are mainly found between drift and new fallen snow and the old snowpack (unstable layer of faceted crystals). In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability."
