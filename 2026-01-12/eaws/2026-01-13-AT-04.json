Attention should be paid to older, partly somewhat covered prone-to-triggering wind slabs and locally small-scale fresh wind slabs. It is still possible for medium-sized slab avalanches to be triggered by small additional loads in steep terrain, especially in areas adjacent to the ridgeline, crests or summits and in filled-in bowls and gullies. As temperatures become milder and the snowfall level rises to around 1500 metres, wet loose snow avalanches and wet snow avalanches are possible from steep slopes.",
