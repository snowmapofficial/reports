Caution is to be exercised at their margins in particular. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are large. Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack confirm this situation. <br/> Additionally in isolated cases dry avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach quite a large size on shady slopes. <br/> On very steep shady slopes individual dry avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. In particular steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent moist avalanches are to be expected from the early morning, even medium-sized ones. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience and great restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area over a wide area 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell on Saturday above approximately 1200 m. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. On Monday it will be sunny. The wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 70 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Tuesday: In some regions decrease in danger of dry avalanches.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2026-01-12T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-01-13T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-01-12"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":3,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NW","N","SE","S","E","W","NE","SW"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":3,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NW","N","E","NE"]},{"problemType":"new_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["NW","N","SE","S","E","W","NE","SW"]}],"bulletinID":"331ba0d5-4702-4da8-b0dc-289be0d17ff4","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"considerable","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
