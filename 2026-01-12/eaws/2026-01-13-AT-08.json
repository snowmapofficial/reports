        "comment": "One single person can trigger slab avalanches in the old snow. If the fracture sweeps away the entire snowpack, the release can grow to medium size. Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the snowpack surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings cannot be ruled out. In addition, small-sized fresh snowdrifts require special caution in high altitude ridgeline terrain and pass zones. Activities in backcountry demand experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing dangers.  In zones with rain impact, increasingly frequent wet snowslides and avalanches are also possible.",
