They can be released easily.","comment":"The fresh wind slabs can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on southwest to north to southeast facing aspects above the tree line and on steep south facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. In many cases avalanches are rather small. In particular in shady places that are protected from the wind they can release the weakly bonded old snow as well and reach medium size. <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases, especially at elevated altitudes. <br/> Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in gullies and bowls. In the regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 3 (considerable) the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 30 cm of snow fell in the last few days.
