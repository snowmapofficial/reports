Deeper layers of the snowpack are relatively well consolidated in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose. In these regions, avalanches can start deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>Numerous natural avalanches, as well as various avalanches triggered by human activity, some remotely over relatively large distances, are evidence of the current widespread instability of the snowpack.
