        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow throughout.  No visibility throughout the day above 600 metres.  Winds 30 -40 mph.",
        "Comment": "Cooler and less windy outlook. New snow amounts are not expected to be great, prepare to alter plans if greater volumes of snow arrive.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Becoming colder, the freezing level will lower to around 600 metres through the course of the morning. Snow showers overnight and on Tuesday and moderate to fresh generally South-Westerly winds will affect the area. Snow accumulation is not expected to be great with 1-2 cm expected perhaps 5 in places.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will start to re-freeze improving general stability, localised accumulations of unstable windslab will form in areas such as sheltered gullies and on slopes with a North-West through North to Easterly aspect mainly above 850 metres, these accumulations are not expected to be deep or extensive and should in the main be avoidable, Fragile cornices may form above  these aspects.  The avalanche hazard will be Low",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Rain and mainly wet snow at the highest levels with strong to gale force generally South-Westerly winds have affected the area.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snow cover has reduced particularly at lower levels with the milder and wet conditions. The remaining snow is generally moist and stable but some wet snow instabilities remain on the steepest slopes mainly above 950 metres in sheltered gullies and on slopes with a North-West through North to Easterly aspect.   The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Strong South-West winds initially, ease to become moderate to fresh. Showers fall as snow only on the higher summits initially, but down to 400 metres by the end of the period. The freezing level slowly drops through the period to around 500 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will continue to consolidate and stability will be good. It will become firm on the surface at higher elevations. Isolated and shallow areas of windslab will develop through the period mainly on North to East aspects above 600 metres. These are expected to be easily avoidable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "SnowStability": "The current diminished and moist snowpack lying on most aspects above 600m will stabilise and refreeze.

Coire rims and gully tops mostly affected.  The avalanche hazard will be Low",
