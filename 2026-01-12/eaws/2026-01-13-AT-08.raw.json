Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the snowpack surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings cannot be ruled out. In addition, small-sized fresh snowdrifts require special caution in high altitude ridgeline terrain and pass zones. Activities in backcountry demand experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing dangers.  In zones with rain impact, increasingly frequent wet snowslides and avalanches are also possible."

Bonding to the often loosely-packed, faceted, expansively metamorphosed old snowpack surface, often with surface hoar, continues to be moderate-to-poor in places. In addition, layers inside the recent fresh snow and drifts are often still prone to triggering. Up to intermediate altitudes the snowpack has been weakened in places by rain impact."
