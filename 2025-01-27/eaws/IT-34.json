As a consequence of a strong to storm force wind from southwesterly directions, deep wind slabs will form.

This applies in particular at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. <br/> New snow is lying on a moist old snowpack. This applies below the tree line. <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
