In the night to Tuesday, danger level 4 (high) is expected to be reached from eastern Ticino via Val Moesa, Rheinwald, Avers and Val Bregaglia to the Bernina region. Numerous medium and large naturally triggered avalanches are expected in these regions. Very large avalanches may also occur, especially in the high Alpine regions, but they will not advance all that far because there is very little snow in the avalanche tracks. However, high-altitude transport routes will be at risk. The avalanche situation for winter sport participants will also become critical in the far west and in the other regions of Grisons and Ticino.</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p>Overnight to Wednesday there will be some precipitation, especially in the west.
