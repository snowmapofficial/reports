        "comment": "The sometimes strong wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. The wind slabs are mostly small but to be assessed with care and prudence, especially on very steep slopes adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> As the temperature drops only isolated mostly small moist avalanches are possible below approximately 2500 m.",
