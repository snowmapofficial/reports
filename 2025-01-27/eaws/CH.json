As a consequence of a sometimes storm force southwesterly wind, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day. Single winter sport participants can release avalanches easily. Individual natural avalanches are possible. The avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow and reach medium size. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.",
