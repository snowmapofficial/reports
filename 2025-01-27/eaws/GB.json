New accumulations developing on East through South to West aspects with windslab present on North-West through North to North-East aspects. Greatest amounts around gullies and corrie headwalls.

A fresh breeze throughout mainly from North-North-East backing to North-North-West by afternoon.\nObserved Weather Influences: Overnight, snow from 500 metres but thawing as the freezing level rose to 900 metres in the morning. Generally dry for most of the day with the cloud base around 600 metres.  The overnight variable strong winds eased, light Easterlies by day.\nObservedSnowStability: Areas of moderately bonded windslab is present in wind sheltered terrain on most aspects above 900 metres. Gullies, corrie rims and scarp slopes are holding greatest amounts. Cornices have formed above many of these locations. Elsewhere there is a covering of shallow wet snow with deeper drifts above 600 metres.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
