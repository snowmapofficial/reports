Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, mostly on W/N/E facing slopes and behind protruberances in the landscape. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.  In isolated cases, small slab avalanches can be triggered on high-altitude extremely steep shady slopes, usually by large additional loading and where the snow is shallow."

Fresh snow and drifts are prone to triggering particularly on steep shady slopes where they lie deposited atop soft layers. On encrusted and moistened sunny slopes the fresh snow is better consolidated. All in all, the old snowpack is well consolidated. At lower altitudes there is little snow on the ground."

Danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude, particularly on W/N/E facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls.

In isolated cases, small slab avalanches can be triggered on high-altitude extremely steep shady slopes also in the old snow, usually by large additional loading and where the snow is shallow."
