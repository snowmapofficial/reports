These can in some cases be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> At low and intermediate altitudes the avalanche situation is generally favourable."

      "comment" : "Up to high altitudes rain fell during the day in particular at the southern border of Aran. 5 cm of snow, but less in some localities, will fall in the next few hours above approximately 1500 m. The southwesterly wind will transport the new snow. As a consequence of falling temperatures the snowpack will consolidate during the course of the night. <br/> <br/> In particular adjacent to ridgelines: Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
