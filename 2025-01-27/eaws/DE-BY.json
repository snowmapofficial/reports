Main problem: new snow that can trigger spontaneously as slab avalanches by a single person. Avalanche prone locations are found on steep W-N-E facing slopes adjacent to and distant from ridgelines, as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. In extremely steep terrain new snow can also release naturally as loose snow avalanches in all aspects. Such avalanches can become large in rare cases. In addition, medium-sized glide snow avalanches can trigger naturally on very steep slopes with smooth ground. Be cautious esp. in sparesly wooded mountain forests and grass-covered slopes.",
