On the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais between the Dufourspitze and the Nufenen Pass as well as on the central part of the southern flank of the Alps, fresh snow will be deposited on Monday on a highly faceted and often thin snowpack.

The snowdrift accumulations formed by the foehn wind on Saturday are becoming increasingly stable. Only on slopes sheltered from the wind is there still loose, faceted snow on the surface, sometimes with hoar frost.
