They are to be bypassed in particular in extremely steep terrain. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in the vicinity of peaks. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Very steep grassy slopes: A latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. <br/> <br/> In many places there is a danger of falling on the hard crust."

      "comment" : "The old wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack at elevated altitudes. They are lying on a crust. <br/> <br/> In particular in shady places that are protected from the wind: The upper section of the snowpack is weak; its surface is loosely bonded and consists of surface hoar and faceted crystals. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 90 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
