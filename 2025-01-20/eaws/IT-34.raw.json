Avalanches can in very isolated cases penetrate near-ground layers of the snowpack and reach medium size. The mostly small wind slabs are barely recognisable. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> On rocky sunny slopes loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small."
