One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger small slab avalanches in such zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes where snow is sufficient, small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches can be releases, esp. on steep sun-bathed slopes slides and small-to-medium sized wet-snow avalanches are possible."

The foehn-impacted nocturnal hours will be mild, clouds often hampering outgong longwave radiation so that only a breakable crust can form on the snowpack surface. Steep high-altitude north-facing slopes often still have powder snow. Mostly shallow old snowpack surfaces are generally well consolidated. On sunny slopes, the uppermost layers often moisten during daytime hours, at lower altitudes the ground becomes bare of snow. Below 1500m there is little snow on the ground."
