        "SnowStability": "Anticipating only a modest amount of new wind drifted snow on steep South East through South to South West aspects above 950m. Much of it will accumulate on bare ground and offer very limited hazard. Elsewhere there will be a cosmetic cover of fresh snow down to 900m. High altitude old snow patches will refreeze and become firm or crusty.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Main accumulations are centred on the steep North to East South East aspects of Creag Meagaidh summit area and Coire Ardair, mainly above 950m.
