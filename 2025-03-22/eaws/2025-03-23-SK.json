        "comment": "Moderate avalanche danger in the high altitudes of the High, Western and Low Tatras, 2nd degree.  Small to medium-sized spontaneous avalanches from wet snow may occur on steep slopes during the day as the weather warms up. On north (shaded) slopes, in couloirs, under saddles and rock faces, there are hard snow slabs and pillows that are not sufficiently bonded to the ground. Avalanche release in these areas is possible, especially with high additional loads.",
        "highlights": "Due to the warming temperatures and predicted snowfall /rain/, the main avalanche problem is WET SNOW."

Above this limit, new snow will be added, from 5 to 15 cm, below this the snow cover will diminish due to rain and the snow will be wet.  On the northern slopes at high altitudes (above 2000 m), the snow remains dry, often in the form of hard slabs and pillows, and during the coming snowfall and strong southerly winds, another 10 to 20 cm of snow will be added. At altitudes below 1500 m, there is only a patchy snow cover."
