        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong southerly wind, avalanche prone wind slabs formed by Saturday in particular on west, north and east facing slopes. The fresh wind slabs can be released very easily or triggered naturally. In many cases they are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can be released easily or triggered naturally. At the border to Benasque, at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and at the border to Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for experience and restraint. The avalanche prone locations are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs represent the main danger. Dry snow slides and avalanches require caution."

As a consequence of falling temperatures the snowpack will consolidate during the next few days. 10 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last two days above approximately 2000 m. The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. On Sunday it will be cold. 5 to 15 cm of snow will fall. The wind will be light."
