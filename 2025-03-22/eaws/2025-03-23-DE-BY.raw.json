      "comment" : "Avalanche danger is moderate above 1500m. Gliding snow is the main problem. On very steep slopes in all aspects, wet glide-snow avalanches can release naturally over smooth ground, releases mostly small sized. In addition small wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep terrain. In isolated cases, the old snow on very steep ridgeline terrain in northern aspects can be problematic. Small slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow."

When moisture reaches ground level, the snowpack can begin to glide over smooth ground. Otherwise the snowpack is stable. Only on shady slopes at high altitudes is the near-surface snow still loose and dry. In a few places there is a weak layer at ground level. As the result of a bit of fresh snow and wind, small snowdrift patches can be forems. On south-facing slopes the ground is mostly bare of snow."
