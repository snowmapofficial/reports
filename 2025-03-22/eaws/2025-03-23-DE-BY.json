On very steep slopes in all aspects, wet glide-snow avalanches can release naturally over smooth ground, releases mostly small sized. In addition small wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep terrain. In isolated cases, the old snow on very steep ridgeline terrain in northern aspects can be problematic. Small slab avalanches can be triggered by minimum additional loading, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow.",
