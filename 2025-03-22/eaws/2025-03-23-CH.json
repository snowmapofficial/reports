On the northern flank of the Alps, the snowpack structure is otherwise quite favourable. In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are weak layers prone to triggering in the central part of the snowpack. Especially along the central and eastern parts of the Main Alpine Ridge and to the south of there, avalanches can also be triggered on shady slopes in near-ground layers of the snowpack. Fresh snow having fallen, breaks in the weak layers of old snow are becoming more probable.</p><p>The snowpack is slowly becoming increasingly water-saturated and  southern slopes up into high Alpine regions and western slopes below approximately 2200 m are already saturated. The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes is still mostly dry, but the diffuse sunshine in recent days has also had a significant warming effect in these areas. This is probably why gliding avalanches have been observed in recent days, especially on north- and east-facing slopes. Despite falling temperatures, gliding avalanches in particular, but also isolated wet snow avalanches, are still possible.</p>"
