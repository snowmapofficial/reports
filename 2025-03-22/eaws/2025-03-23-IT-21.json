The fresh snow of the weekend as well as the large wind slabs to be found above all in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain can be released naturally above approximately 2200 m. On very steep slopes the avalanches can be triggered in the various layers of new snow and reach a dangerous size. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection. Numerous large to very large avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of new snow and strong wind.
