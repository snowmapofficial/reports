Such avalanche prone locations are quite prevalent and are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are quite large. Areas that are largely protected from the wind where surface hoar has been covered with snow are especially precarious. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are to be expected.

Sunshine and high temperatures gave rise on Thursday to moistening of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2900 m. As a consequence of highly fluctuating temperatures a crust formed on the surface during the last few days, this also applies on shady slopes below approximately 2000 m. <br/> In particular at intermediate altitudes less snow than usual is lying.
