      "comment" : "In some places avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier, generate small-to-medium sized releases, mostly above 2200m in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. Freshly generated snowdrift accumjlations are prone to triggering, require attentiveness in steep terrain. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are still possible. Caution urged below glide cracks."

      "comment" : "The snowpack was able to consolidate up to high altitudes. Particularly on shady slopes there are weak layers evident which can easily be triggered. Snowpack surfaces are often powdery on shady, wind-protected slopes. Elsewhere there are wind crusts and a melt-freeze crust evident. As a result of strong to storm-velocity S/SW winds, small snowdrift accumulations are being generated afresh. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten on steep sunny slopes."

At high altitudes, small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are frequently prone to triggering. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall need due consideration. On very steep grass-covered slopes, small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally."
