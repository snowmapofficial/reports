        "comment": "In some places avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier, generate small-to-medium sized releases, mostly above 2200m in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. Freshly generated snowdrift accumjlations are prone to triggering, require attentiveness in steep terrain. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are still possible. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
