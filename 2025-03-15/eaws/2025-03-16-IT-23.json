The new snow and wind slabs of last week are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. They remain for the foreseeable future prone to triggering. In particular above approximately 2300 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. As a consequence of the snowfall, the likelihood of avalanches being released will increase on steep slopes. The wind slabs will be covered with new snow and therefore barely recognisable. <br/> The avalanches can be released by a single winter sport participant, in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and artificially triggered avalanches confirm an unfavourable avalanche situation on very steep shady slopes. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection.",
