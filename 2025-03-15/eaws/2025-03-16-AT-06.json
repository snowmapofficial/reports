Danger spots are located in the expositions northwest via north to east. Small to medium slab avalanches can be triggered by an individuals in steep slopes. Caution behind ridgelines. Small spontaneous loose-snow avalanches coming from extremely steep terrain are possible. Gliding-snow avalanches coming from steep grassy terrain cannot be ruled out.",
