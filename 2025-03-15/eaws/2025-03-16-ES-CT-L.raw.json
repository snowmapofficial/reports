These can be released by people or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in steep terrain at intermediate and high altitudes and in places that are protected from the wind. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation moist avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can in some cases be released by people and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. These avalanche prone locations are covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise."

The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack."
