        "SnowDistribution": "Good snow cover above 700 metres. Some cloud over the summits but visibility mainly good. Winds approx 10 to 25 mph at summit levels.",
        "Comment": "Dry settled weather expected to continue into early next week.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions expected throughout the forecast period. Moderate North-Westerly winds will veer to become North-Easterly during the day.  The freezing level will rise from 900 metres to 1100 metres during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to stabilised in most areas as lingering weaknesses slowly diminish. Some light drifting is expected at higher altitudes with localised accumulations of soft windslab on some wind sheltered steep East through South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres. This will begin to stabilise during the day.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A dry day with fresh Westerly winds.  The freezing level rose to 900 metres by midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Drifting snow at summit levels. Localised accumulations of soft windslab have developed on North-East to South-East aspects above 950 metres. On an East aspect at 1100 metres, a small area of avalanche debris was noted on a steep and convex slope.  Elsewhere the snowpack continues to stabilise and is mostly well bonded.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The recent windslab accumulations that are present above 1000 metres on South-East to South-West aspects, continue to consolidate in the strong sunlight and are generally becoming well bonded. The superficial snow is now being affected by a rising freezing level and solar radiation, with a fairly rapid reduction in cover taking place.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

It fell on to mostly bare ground and is not significant. Older snow patches, which are firm and stable persist, mainly on North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres.
