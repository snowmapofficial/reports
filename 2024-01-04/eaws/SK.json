        "comment": "There is an CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in the Western Tatras and in the west of the Low and High Tatras (level 3). Due to the westerly flow, most new snow has been added in the western parts of the Tatras. In the last 3 days up to 50 cm of new snow. The snowfall limit varied but above 1500 m above sea level the temperatures were still below 0\u00b0C. Very strong north-westerly wind persists. The main problem is therefore wind blown snow. The steep troughs of the highest altitudes are dangerous, where the wind has deposited snow slabs and cushions and created cornices. Due to the strong winds, we do not recommend long and difficult hikes on the ridges. Below the 1500 m mark, mostly wet snow fell, which bound well with the ground.",
