Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain,  behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and increase in size and frequency with ascending altitude. A small-to-medium slab avalanche or loose-snow avalanche can be triggered by 1 person (in high-alpine terrain larger). Activities in backcountry demand experience in outlying terrain and the ability to assess avalanche dangers on-site, as well as a cautious route selection. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger below 2600 m at any time of day or night and reach large size. Caution urged below glide cracks. With daytime warming, loose snowslides are possible in sunny steep rocky terrain.",

Bonding deteriorates with ascending altitude. Weak trigger-prone layers are evident inside the fresh snowdrift accumulations. On high-altitude shady slopes the surface is powdery, elsewhere there are often melt-freeze crusts and wind crusts evident. Warm ground and the wet snowpack base reinforce the gliding movements of the entire snowpack. Frequent glide-snow avalanches have been reported. "
