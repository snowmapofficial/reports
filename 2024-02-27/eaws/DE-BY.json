In isolated cases, snowdrifts can be triggered by large additional loading, e.g. a group without distances. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain on NW/N/NE facing slopes, their frequency increases with ascending altitude, releases of medium size are possible.\r\nGliding snow requires attentiveness. On steep smooth slopes, glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in all aspects, reaching medium size at high altitudes.\r\nThe daytime danger of small wet-snow avalanches is also a threat on very steep rocky slopes.",

Here small snowdrift accumulations can be generated by S/W winds which will be deposited atop loose powder or surface hoar, in either case prone to triggering. Increasing cloud cover and warm temperatures are making the snowpack wetter also on shady slopes. Little or now snow on the ground well into intermediate altitudes."
