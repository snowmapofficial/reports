The snowpack is soft; its surface is loosely bonded and consists of surface hoar and faceted crystals. Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack in particular on shady slopes. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a freshening northerly foehn wind, small wind slabs will form in the course of the day adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. The wind slabs are lying on soft layers especially on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m."
