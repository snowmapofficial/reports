In regions exposed to the foehn wind the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be released in the old snowpack and reach medium size, in particular on very steep northwest, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Especially slopes adjacent to ridgelines are unfavourable. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase in the high Alpine regions. They are difficult to recognise. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."
