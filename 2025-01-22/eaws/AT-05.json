        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low, the major danger stems from snowdrifts. Particularly on very steep shady slopes above the timberline, slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated cases by minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur also distant from ridges, behind protruberances and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, particularly on W/N/E facing slopes. On steep shady slopes, fractures down to more deeply embedded layers are possible, thus making avalanches grow larger. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow. Isolated naturally triggered glide-snow and loose-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night.",
