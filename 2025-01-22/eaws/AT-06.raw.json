Danger spots are usually located in shady northwesterly to easterly expositions, especially in entries to extremely steep gullies and bowls. Here medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by high additional loads."

      "comment" : "Due to mild sunny weather the snow cover got wet in sunny high-altitude slopes. During the night surface hoar is formed there and partially firn-like snow. onshady slopes the snow cover is built by faceted snow crystals and the layers are poorly bonded. On the surface a powdery snow layer can be found, underneath that weak layers are forming which are destabilizing the snow base. The snow cover is in general unusually thin, considering the season. Only in blown-in gullies and bowls compact snow packs with a higher amount of snow are found."
