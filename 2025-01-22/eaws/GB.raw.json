        "SnowStability": "Isolated and shallow areas of unstable windslab will develop during the day mainly on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. These will mainly lie on bare ground and should be easily avoidable. Elsewhere above 600 metres there will be a dusting of fresh snow. Remaining patches of older snow will be frozen and firm.
