        "comment": "The snow cover is mostly packed and well consolidated. The avalanche situation is stable due to plus temperatures, rain and subsequent cooling. Avalanches can be released only sporadically, mainly on the northern slopes of the High and Western Tatras. Large additional loads are needed on steep and very steep slopes. In such a case a small avalanche or avalanche can be expected. The danger is rather due to the lack of snow, protruding rocks and rock thresholds.",
        "highlights": "A predominantly favourable situation."
