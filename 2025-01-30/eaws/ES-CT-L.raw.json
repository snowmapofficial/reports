      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, extensive wind slabs will form in all aspects. This snow and in particular the often deep wind slabs can be released very easily above the tree line. In some cases the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Especially from the border with Benasque to the border with Ribagor√ßa and Pallars these avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> Stability tests and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate a very precarious avalanche situation on wind-loaded slopes. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation moist loose snow avalanches are possible from midday, but they will be mostly small. <br/> Extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and great restraint are required."

      "comment" : "Especially in the south and in the southwest 15 to 20 cm of snow has fallen since Tuesday. 15 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until late morning above approximately 1200 m. The northwesterly wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> The upper section of the snowpack is unfavourably layered and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
