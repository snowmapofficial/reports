        "SnowDistribution": "Snow above 400 metres with a thin crust in many places.  Cold clear conditions.  Winds 15-25 mph.",
        "Comment": "Thaw conditions forecast to return Saturday evening.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow showers on Strong South-Easterly winds will clear to give a mainly dry day with moderate Southerly winds. The freezing level will gradually rise to reach around 1000 metres during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will continue to slowly consolidate and stability will be good. Overnight isolated deposits of windslab will develop mainly on steep West to North aspects above 850 metres. These deposits are expected to be shallow, limited in extent and consolidate as the day progresses. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "Comment": "Good snow cover and a very wintry scene. Crusty snow just holding weight when you get to higher slopes !",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Some snow showers overnight dying out by daybreak.\r\nFreezing level around 500m rising to around 1000m during the day. Winds, fresh to strong South-Easterly overnight easing and veering becoming Southerly by the end of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Generally the snowpack on all aspects above 600m will be well bonded and stable. Some new isolated deposits of moderately bonded windslab will form overnight on mainly North-West to Northerly aspects above 900m, mainly where deposits gain depth, at the tops of gullies or around coire rims. This will largely be due to redistributed snow. Stability here will improve during the day. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",

Above 800 metres some isolated accumulations of windslab are present on East to South-East aspects, mostly in steep wind sheltered places with some minor weakness within, but generally these deposits are well bonded.  These are mostly located in  hollows, coire rims and gully tops. The avalanche hazard is Low",

Isolated instabilities can also be found on both West and North-East aspects at this altitude. The very tops of gullies and corrie rims are most affected. Exposed ridges are wind-scoured with little snow.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
