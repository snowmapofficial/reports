The avalanche prone locations are covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Even single persons can release avalanches in some places. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes above approximately 2000 m. In very isolated cases they can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach large size. Whumpfing sounds serve as an alarm indicating the danger. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for caution and restraint. <br/> Individual loose snow avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones.",
