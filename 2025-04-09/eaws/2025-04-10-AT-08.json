        "comment": "Winter sports enthusiasts can often trigger small-to-medium avalanches in the old snow. Danger zones occur mostly on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry skiing tours demand a very conscious route selection. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, fresh snowdrifts require caution. During the course of the day, esp. on steep sun-basked slopes, small wet-snow avalanches are possible. Small, in zones with heavy snowfall also medium-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible and difficult to estimate.",
