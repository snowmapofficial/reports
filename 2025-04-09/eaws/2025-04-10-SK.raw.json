      "comment" : "In the High, Western and Western part of the Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger - 2nd degree. During Thursday, we expect a cold front to pass through, which will again bring cooling, precipitation and very strong winds. The wind will blow the new snow to the leeward sides of the mountains (SE and SW), where it will be deposited in slabs of varying thickness and hardness. Their distribution will be very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Often under saddles, rock walls and in leeward troughs, where new snow will be deposited to a thickness of more than 50 cm. Avalanche release is possible on very steep to extremely steep slopes, especially with higher additional loads.",
      "highlights" : "Beware of strong winds with snow - slab avalanches on the leeward sides."
