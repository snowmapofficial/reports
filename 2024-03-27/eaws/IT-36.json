        "comment": "The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs that are forming during the snowfall must be evaluated with care and prudence at intermediate and high altitudes. This applies in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. In all aspects large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and wind. <br/> The rain will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack over a wide area in particular at low and intermediate altitudes. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> Avalanches can be released, even by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. The weather report and anticipated change in the avalanche danger are uncertain.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses."
