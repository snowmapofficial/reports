Some ridges and surfaces adjacent to ridgelines have been blown completely clear. The fresh wind slabs are mostly medium to large and sometimes prone to triggering. Snow will continue to drift on Tuesday night into Wednesday. A lot of new snow will fall on the Main Alpine Ridge and south of it, which will be heavily transported by the southerly wind. Large wind slabs will form here, even at a distance from ridgelines.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places and for the most part do not contain distinct weak layers. Last week, the old snowpack was soaked up to approximately 3000 m on south-facing slopes, up to 2000-2500 m on east- and west-facing slopes, and up to approximately 1800-2000 m on north-facing slopes.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and on north-facing slopes below approximately 2000 m. These may be large.</p>"
