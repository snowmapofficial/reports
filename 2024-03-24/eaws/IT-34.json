        "comment": "In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as at elevated altitudes precarious wind slabs formed. The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant above the tree line. As a consequence of solar radiation gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible.",
        "highlights": "Some fresh snow as well as the mostly small wind slabs represent the main danger. The danger of moist small and medium sized avalanches will increase during the day."

Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as in places that are protected from the wind. Moist and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, in particular on steep slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as at the base of rock walls above the tree line. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/>"
