        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a strong wind from northwesterly directions, mostly small wind slabs formed on Sunday. They have formed in particular from the western part of the northern flank of the Alps to the border to France. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep slopes above approximately 2500 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. They are in some cases prone to triggering. In particular at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions these avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is slightly greater. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Hardly any more moist and wet avalanches are possible.",
        "highlights": "Fresh and older wind slabs represent the main danger. The snowpack will be generally favourable."
