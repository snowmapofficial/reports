        "comment": "With the passage of the cold front, the snow cover stabilized, froze and hardened.  Between 5 and 15 cm of new snow has fallen in the highest areas, which is being transported by westerly winds to east-facing slopes. Smaller snow slabs and cushions may occur sporadically in such oriented troughs and moguls. High altitude steep to extremely steep couloirs and saddles with large amounts of blowing snow are critical. Danger spots are rare, especially on leeward orientations where there is a larger amount of blown snow on the old base.",

This snow is less bonded to the subsoil. In the middle altitudes, where the rain turned to snow, the new snow is well bonded to the substrate or the surface is hard to icy. At lower and middle elevations, the snow cover is no longer continuous."
