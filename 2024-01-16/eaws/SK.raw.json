Especially the northern exposures with loose, slab snow are dangerous, also steep slopes under rock walls and places with a significant change of slope. Avalanche release is possible with only a small additional load; spontaneous avalanches are also possible.",

However, this is already being transported to the leeward, mainly northern slopes during Wednesday. Here it is deposited in variously hard snow slabs, which are prone to avalanche when loaded. It will warm up considerably during the day, with isotherms of 0°C rising to above 1600 m above sea level in the afternoon and evening. Snow at lower and middle altitudes will become wetter and set. At altitudes up to 1000 m above sea level, new snow will be directly on the ground, without any old snow."
