        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. Caution is to be exercised in all aspects in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These can be released easily in some cases above the tree line. This also applies in areas close to the tree line. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in all aspects. The wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. They are to be avoided as far as possible. Even a small avalanche can sweep winter sport participants along and give rise to falls. In isolated cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> In addition further very occasional gliding avalanches are possible, in particular on steep southeast, south and southwest facing slopes below approximately 2300 m. In isolated cases the gliding avalanches are quite large, in particular in the regions with a lot of snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
