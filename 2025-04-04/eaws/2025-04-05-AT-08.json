        "comment": "The recent snowdrifts are still prone to triggering, one sole skier can trigger small-to-medium sized avalanches. Danger zones occur in very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes which are difficult to recognize, they increase with ascending altitude. Backcountry tours require an well-considered route selection. Avalanche danger increases during the course of the day. Particularly in intensively sun-bathed steep terrain, increasingly also on shady slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalances remains difficult to assess. Backcountry tours need to be brought to a close early in the day.",
