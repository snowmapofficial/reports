In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches may be triggered there.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into the high Alpine regions and on northern slopes below 1700 m. On eastern and western slopes, the snowpack is becoming increasingly saturated between 2400 and 3000 m. At these altitudes in regions with a weak snowpack structure, weak layers in the old snowpack are starting to become saturated for the first time.

In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches may be triggered there.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into the high Alpine regions and on northern slopes below 1700 m. On eastern and western slopes, the snowpack is becoming increasingly saturated between 2400 and 3000 m. At these altitudes in regions with a weak snowpack structure, weak layers in the old snowpack are starting to become saturated for the first time. As a result, moist slab avalanches may occur spontaneously and may also be triggered by people.</p><p>During the clear night to Saturday, a strong melt-freeze crust will form on steep sunny slopes above approximately 2000 m.
