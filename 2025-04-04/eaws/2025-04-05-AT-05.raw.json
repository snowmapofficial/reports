Wet loose-snow and slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading in some places below 2600m and grow to medium size, either triggered by persons or naturally. Slab avalanches can trigger in the old snow in some places by large additional loading. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deep snow. Esp. on W/N/E-facing slopes above 2200m, avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and grow to large size. On extremely steep sunny slopes below 2600m, wet loose-snow and slab avalanches of medium size are possible, naturally triggered or person-triggered. On steep grass-covered slopes below 2400m, medium-sized glide-snow avalanches are possible."
