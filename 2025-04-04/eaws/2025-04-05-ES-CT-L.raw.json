Small to medium-sized natural avalanches are to be expected in all aspects. Moist avalanches can in some cases be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released very easily on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls."

The spring-like weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Weak layers exist in the top section of the old snowpack on shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is required."
