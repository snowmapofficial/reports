        "Comment": "Fine weather continuing.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Another dry sunny day with moderate East-South-Easterly winds. Colder than recently although temperatures on the highest summits will remain above freezing.",
        "SnowStability": "The remaining patchy snow will remain well bonded and stable. The snow surface will become firm overnight, softening where exposed to the sun during the day. Greatest amounts remain in North and East facing gullies and coire rims above 1100 metres, very little if any snow elsewhere. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
