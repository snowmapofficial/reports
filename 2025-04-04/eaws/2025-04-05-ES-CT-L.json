        "comment": "From the early morning as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist avalanches, in particular at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars. Small to medium-sized natural avalanches are to be expected in all aspects. Moist avalanches can in some cases be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released very easily on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls.",
