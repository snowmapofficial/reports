        "comment": "Small and medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation. This applies in particular on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m. They can in some cases release the saturated snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> The wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. They can be released, mostly by large loads and reach medium size, in particular adjacent to ridgelines. As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of slab avalanches being released will increase gradually. <br/> Gliding avalanches can also occur. Caution is to be exercised on grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m.",
