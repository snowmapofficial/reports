Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m, as well as on very steep west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can in some cases release the wet snowpack. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur, in particular on grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> Early morning: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m.
