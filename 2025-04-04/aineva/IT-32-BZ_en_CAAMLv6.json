They can in some cases release the saturated snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. This applies in particular on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m. <br/> <br/> Late morning: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. Afternoon: As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of slab avalanches being released will increase appreciably. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Gliding avalanches can also occur. Caution is to be exercised on grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m."

Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack over a wide area in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m. <br/> <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used west, north and east facing slopes. This applies on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, as well as on west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m."
