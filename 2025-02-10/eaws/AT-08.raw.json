At high altitudes, small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are frequently prone to triggering. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall need due consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is difficult to estimate. Caution urged below glide-cracks."

Snowpack surfaces are often powdery on shady, wind-protected slopes. Elsewhere there are wind crusts and a melt-freeze crust evident. Elsewhere a wind crust is evident which is often capable of bearing loads, on sunny slopes there is a melt-crust. Small snowdrift accumulations are evident. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten/soften on steep sunny slopes. At high altitudes fresh drifts are evident over small areas. Older drifts are generally quite compact."
