        "comment": "In all high mountains of Slovakia there is only a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. The situation is stable, the snow cover is melted and hardened. Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in the highest altitudes of the Tatras, and even then only on isolated steep to very steep slopes of the northern exposures. On south-facing steep slopes, smaller avalanches of wet snow may occur in sunlight. The greater terrain hazard under current conditions is the potential for falling on icy or rocky surfaces.",
        "highlights": "Generally favourable avalanche situation."

      "snowpackStructure": {
        "comment": "The snow cover is significantly below average for this time of year. Continuous snow cover is only found in the highest mountain ranges (above 1500 m above sea level). Due to the absence of any precipitation and the change in temperatures, the snow cover has settled and frozen. Its surface is mainly made of frozen firn, on the northern slopes of the crust, locally wind-blown snow pillows. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice. On steep sunlit slopes the snow surface softens slightly."
