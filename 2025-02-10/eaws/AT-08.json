At high altitudes, small freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are frequently prone to triggering. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall need due consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is difficult to estimate. Caution urged below glide-cracks.",
