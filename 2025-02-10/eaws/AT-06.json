On sunny slopes surface hoar is formed during the night which will soften during the day. On shady areas the snow on top is often still loose and in exposed areas hard and wind pressed. The snow base is partially moist, gliding movements of the snow cover can not be ruled out.  In medium and low altitudes only little amount of snow is found."
