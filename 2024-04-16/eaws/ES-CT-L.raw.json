      "comment" : "The surface of the snow cover is brown due to the effect of the Sahara dust. The surface of the snowpack has frozen to form a strong crust and will hardly soften at all. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
