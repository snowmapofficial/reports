        "comment": "In the High and Western Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger above 2000 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially the leeward sides of ridges, narrow couloirs and places under rock walls are dangerous. Particularly in these places there may be wind-blown slabs of varying hardness. They can be loosened, especially on steep slopes with high additional loads. Particularly dangerous are S, SE and E orientations. Small to medium sized slab avalanches are a risk in combination with terrain traps. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",
        "highlights": "Watch out for wind-slabs on leeward sides. At the highest elevations there may be locally more new snow."
