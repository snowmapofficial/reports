Wet-snow avalanches can fracture down to ground level and grow to medium size, esp. in zones with sufficient snow. Runout zones should be avoided. Freshly generated snowdrift accumulations can often be triggered by one sole skier, esp. on very steep shady slopes above 2800m. Such danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain, in gullies and bowls.

Weather conditions are making the snowpack ever wetter, leading to a loss of firmness inside the snowpack. High-alpine regions: 10-20cm of fresh snowfall anticipated, locally more. Due to fresh fallen snow and often strong southerly winds, small new snowdrift accumulations will be generated."
