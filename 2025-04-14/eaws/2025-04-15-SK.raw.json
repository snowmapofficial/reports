Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes, where a larger amount of newer snow is concentrated, will be dangerous. Avalanches can be triggered here, especially with higher additional loads, but spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow can also occur. Care should also be taken on the overpasses in the upper parts of the ridges.",
