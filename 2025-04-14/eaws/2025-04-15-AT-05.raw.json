Esp. on steep W/N/E-facing slopes, increasingly frequent slab avalanches are possible. Thy can sweep along the thoroughly wet snowpack and grow to large size, esp. in high-altitude starting zones where there is sufficient snow. Avalanches in steep gullies can in isolated cases plummet down to green zones. In very steep grass-covered terrain, medium-sized glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally all day long. Above 2600m on extremely steep slopes in extended northern aspects, isolated medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier."

The snowpack cannot sufficient radiate outwardly during the nocturnal hours, forms only a thin melt-freeze crust not capable of bearing loads, and softening quickly in the morning hours. High air moisture and local rainfall is making the snowpack even wetter. Weak layers of faceted crystals evident only on extremely steep shady slopes above 2800m.  In high-alpine regios, 5-10cm of fresh snow is anticipated. Due to strong-velocity winds, small snowdrift accumulations will be generated, which esp. on very steep shady slopes will be deposited atop soft layers and will be prone to triggering."
