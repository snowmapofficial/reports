As the penetration by moisture increases wet and gliding avalanches are possible at any time, even large ones in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> During the day: The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger. In many cases avalanches are small but easily released. Especially steep shady slopes high altitudes: They can in isolated cases reach medium size."

The wind will be moderate adjacent to ridgelines. As a consequence of falling temperatures, snowfall and the wind, snow drift accumulations will form. In some places new snow is lying on old snow containing large grains."
