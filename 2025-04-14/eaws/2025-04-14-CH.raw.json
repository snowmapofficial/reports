When water first comes into contact with weak layers, these layers quickly become even weaker.</p><p>During the mostly overcast night into Monday, the snowpack surface will cool only slightly.

The Main Alpine Ridge and south of it will be overcast with precipitation. It will remain mild. The snowfall level will be between 2000 and 2400 m. Above that, 15 to 30 cm of snow will fall.

Otherwise it will be very cloudy with precipitation, which could be particularly heavy on the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais, in Upper Valais, the Gotthard region and in western Ticino. However, the amounts of precipitation are still very uncertain. The snowfall level will gradually fall from between 2000 and 2400 m to below 2000 m in the west as the day progresses.</p><p>The danger of dry avalanches will increase significantly at high altitudes in the regions mentioned that will be exposed to heavier precipitation and is likely to reach level 4 (high).
