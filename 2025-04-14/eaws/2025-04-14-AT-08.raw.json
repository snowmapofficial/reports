Naturally triggered wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can be expected, reaching medium size in high-altitude starting zones. Wet-snow avalanches can be triggered by persons in steep terrain. Due to rainfall, danger below 2400m could rise somewhat. Fresh snowdrifts require attentiveness in very high ridgeline terrain. In addition, the old snowpack can be triggered by large additional loading in extremely steep terrain.  Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution."
