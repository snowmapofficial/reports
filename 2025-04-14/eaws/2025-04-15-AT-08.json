Naturally triggered wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can be expected, reaching medium size in high-altitude starting zones. Wet-snow avalanches can be triggered by persons in steep terrain. In addition, the old snowpack can be triggered by large additional loading in extremely steep terrain.  Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution.",

Danger zones for wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches occur on very steep shady slopes below 2400m, on very steep sunny slopes below 2800m. Following a mild night with overcast skies and reduced outgoing radiation, only a thin melt-freeze crust could form, which will soften up rapidly. Avalanches can trigger naturally in all aspects in high-altutude starting zones. If they sweep along the thoroughly wet old snowpack they can in isolated starting zones where snow is sufficient grow to large size. In addition, the old snowpack can be triggered by large additional loading in extremely steep terrain.  Danger zones occur in seldom-skied backcountry touring terrain, esp. on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection.",
