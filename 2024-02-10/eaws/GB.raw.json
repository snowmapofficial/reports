        "Summary": "TO for 11/2. Old snowpack remnants firm and icy. Soft snow thawing and consolidating. Low hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "A thin covering of soft snow above 400 metres.  Cloudy on the tops all day.  Winds 30-40 mph.",
        "Comment": "Some uncertainty how much snow, if any at all, will reach the Torridon area Sunday afternoon.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry day with the possibility of some summit snow in the afternoon. The freezing level will be around the highest summits falling slightly towards the end of the day. Light predominately Southerly winds will become moderate South-South-Westerly.",
        "SnowStability": "The old snow remnants will remain very firm and icy. The thin covering of soft snow will gradually thaw, with the slightly deeper accumulations that exist on Westerly aspects, largely above 700 metres, quickly consolidating in the warmer temperatures. Snowpack stability will be good. Isolated windslab deposits may develop on steep North and North-East aspects, above 900 metres, during the afternoon. Any new deposits will be shallow and easily avoidable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry day with occasional showers which fell as snow above around 500 metres. Very strong East-South-Easterly winds decreased in strength through the day. The freezing level gradually rose to around 650 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The old snow remnants are firm, icy and stable. A thin covering of fresh snow exists above around 400 metres. Isolated deposits of moderately bonded windslab exist on North-West to South-West aspects largely above 700 metres. These deposits generally overlie bare ground and are shallow, consolidating and confined to gully tops, coire rims and sheltered hollows. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Summary": "LO for 11/2. Patches of windslab on many aspects above 900m. Least stable where it lies on top of the old hard windslab. Mod hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Some soft snow about, old snowpack very hard and icy.  Cloudy on the tops improving through the day.  Winds 20 -30 mph easing through the day.",
        "Comment": "Currently highly variable snowpack, hard and icy in many places, but with pockets of windslab that could catch out the unwary.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be mainly dry overnight and during the morning before some snow arrives late afternoon. The freezing level will be about 1000 metres. Strengthening winds will be from the South.",
        "SnowStability": "Areas of windslab will remain on many aspects. Although often shallow and/or avoidable, these deposits will be poorly bonded, particularly where they lie on top of the old icy snowpack. Most affected will be North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres.  Where fresh windslab sits on bare ground, or where the surface of the old hard snowpack is exposed, stability will be better. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow showers petered out during the day. The freezing level was around 700 metres. Easterly winds became lighter and variable in direction.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Deposits of fresh windslab exist on many aspects above 900 metres. Although generally shallow, the deposits are poorly bonded, particularly where they overlie the old, hard, icy snowpack. This combination tends to be found mostly on North-West through North to East aspects. A human triggered avalanche occurred on a North-East aspects at an altitude of 1050 metres this morning.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate",

        "SnowDistribution": "Whiteout conditions with poor visibility at higher elevations. Fresh snow cover at all levels - some slopes exposed to the wind are firm and scoured. Winds 20-30 mph early in the day but dropped later.",
        "Comment": "Firm snow will remain a potential hazard with poor runouts.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Occasional snow showers are expected during the day above 800 metres. Winds will be light South-South-Easterly overnight, veering to the South-West and becoming strong by the end of the period.

        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will remain on North-West through North to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Accumulations will be localised due to cross loading, but  weak where they gain depth and overlie the older firm snowpack. Areas most affected will be gullies and steep wind sheltered terrain. Later some redistribution of existing snow will create further accumulations on the same aspects. Fresh and unstable cornices will continue to develop. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Persistent snow overnight gave way to continual but light snow showers during the day. The wind was moderate and generally from the South-East. The freezing level was around 700 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab was continually deposited on all aspects above 900 metres. The greatest instability occured where accumulations overlie the older firm snowpack on North-West through North to East aspects, despite being localised due to cross loading. Outwith these areas the snow is firm and mostly scoured or covered in a superficial dusting of fresh soft snow. Fresh and unstable cornices have developed. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

Isolated windslab remains on all Westerly aspects above 900 metres, lying mainly on bare ground and as such should not be significant. Elsewhere the stability will be good. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A prolonged period of light snow through the morning, this cleared to leave a dry afternoon. The moderate Easterly winds eased with the freezing level rising to about 800 metres.",

Accumulations are isolated and have fallen on mainly bare ground. Other aspects are also affected from variable winds with some accumulations on the old frozen snowpack. Elsewhere a generally thin covering of soft stable snow is present above 500 metres which is thawing at lower levels. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
