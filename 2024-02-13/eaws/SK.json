        "comment": "In the High, Low and Western Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger at altitudes above 1700 m a.s.l. Winds from northern directions have created snow slabs and pillows on the southern leeward slopes. Avalanche release is possible here, especially with high additional load. In the lower altitudes it had mainly rained in the previous days, therefore after the subsequent cooling the snow hardened and stabilised. Small spontaneous avalanches may occur, especially after warming in the afternoon on the southern slopes due to sunlight.",
