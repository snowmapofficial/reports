        "Comment": "A milder spell to follow Wednesday night and Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "After a dry night and morning, light showers in the afternoon will initially be summit snow turning to rain at all levels. Light East-South-Easterly winds at dawn will increase to strong by the end of the afternoon. The freezing level will be around 800 metres overnight, rising above all summits during the day.",

Fragile cornices will exist above these aspects. Through the day redistribution will cause localised areas of unstable windslab to also develop in wind sheltered locations on West and North-West aspects, mostly above 950 metres.

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Localised areas of unstable windslab have formed in wind sheltered locations only, on mainly North to East aspects above 900 metres. Localised pockets have also formed on North-West and South-East aspects at this altitude, due to variable winds and cross-loading. The very tops of gullies, around sharply defined corrie rims and ridge flanks are most affected.  Exposed areas are wind-scoured, firm and icy. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
