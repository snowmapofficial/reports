      "comment" : "As the moisture increases individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible by the evening, even medium-sized ones. These can be released by people or triggered naturally. This applies on extremely steep grassy slopes at high altitude, as well as on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. Evening and night: Some snow will fall over a wide area. Gradual increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the snowfall. Rapid decrease in danger of moist avalanches as the temperature drops."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "On Thursday it will be partly cloudy. The high humditiy will give rise by the evening to increasing moistening of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> Shady slopes: The old snowpack remains generally stable. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
