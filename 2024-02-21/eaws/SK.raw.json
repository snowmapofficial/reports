      "comment" : "Warm moist air is expected to arrive from the southwest during Thursday. This change will be accompanied by strong winds. There is a moderate avalanche danger - that is, level 2 on the 5-point international avalanche scale - for all climbs. The main avalanche problem will be wind blown snow and primarily in the NW, NE and N and E orientations of the higher elevations. In such places there will be unstable slabs and pillows of wind-blown snow which will not be sufficiently bonded to the hard underlying layer of old frozen snow. Avalanche release will be possible especially on windward slopes and gullies with high gradients. The second avalanche problem from the mid-elevations downwards will be wet snow, which will become heavier due to warming. Slopes with visible glide cracs will be the most dangerous. Spontaneous foundation avalanches may also occur in these places during the day.",
      "highlights" : "Strong winds with warming - high altitudes winding slabs of unstable snow, mid-altitude rain showers - wet snow."
