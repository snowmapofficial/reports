        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 1600 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. The fresh snow and older drifts at high altitudes are the main problem. The fresh snow can be triggered in some steep terrain. On steep ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, older danger zones have been blanketed. Size and frequency of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. Small-to-medium avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Danger will increase during the course of the day. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the acute danger of falling needs consideration. A cautious route selection is advises. Glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible on steep smooth slopes.",
