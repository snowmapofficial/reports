Initially the snow will be accompanied by not much wind except in the southern ranges. The fresh snow and drifts will cover older drifts or melt-freeze crusts. Where there is wind impact, the drifts will blanket fresh fallen snow which then will be a weak layer.\r\nThe old snowpack is compact and without marked weak layers, topped by a thick crust which is capable of bearing loads (unpleasant for skiers: riddled with water seepage channels).\r\nOn smooth ground the snowpack continues to glide downhill."
