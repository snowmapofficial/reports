The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack. <br/> <br/> The natural avalanche activity will decrease. Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large natural avalanches are nontheless not ruled out. <br/> <br/> Artificially triggered avalanches and field observations confirm the complex avalanche situation. <br/> Off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.",
