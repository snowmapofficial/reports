This applies especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The wind slabs are bonding poorly with the old snowpack. The wind slabs of Tuesday are prone to triggering in all aspects above approximately 2400 m. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. <br/> In very isolated cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Even a small avalanche can sweep snow sport participants along and give rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"The fresh and older wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> In particular shady slopes, above approximately 2600 m: Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> Steep south facing slopes: Hardly any snow is lying. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations.
