        "comment": "Moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) was created in the High and Western Tatras due to moderate snowfall and especially very strong winds, especially above 1800 m above sea level.  Avalanche release on steep slopes is possible especially with additional load. The avalanche danger is very local, concentrated in places where there is old snow under new snow. These two layers could not bond well due to the low temperatures.",

The new snow is transported by very strong winds to leeward places, into troughs, moulds and under rock walls, where its height can reach up to 30-40 cm. Very low air temperatures, which drop to -8 to -16\u00b0C, are also playing a role against the stabilisation of the situation. There is a large temperature gradient in the snow cover, which can cause the formation of dangerous angular snow. Overall, however, the snow cover on the mountains is below average, with only new snow up to 1500 m above sea level."

Increase caution in areas with accumulated large amounts of new snow.",
