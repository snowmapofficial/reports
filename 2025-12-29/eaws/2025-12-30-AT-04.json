Where the drifts lie on a hardness of old snowpack, the binding is not sufficient. The thin snow base, fundament contains faceted crystals that have been transformed by building up. Surface hoar can be covered. The snow depths are very below average, even at high altitudes. Below this, the new fallen snow comes to rest on bare ground."

The weather will improve in the afternoon, the snow showers will subside and the clouds will soften a little. At 1500 metres it will be around -9 degrees, at 2000 metres around -14 degrees, making it much colder than recently.\nWednesday will be sunny at first, very windy, cold and snow showers from the afternoon/evening. From around midday, clouds will predominate, the westerly wind will blow strongly and it will snow at times. At an altitude of 1500 metres it will be -10 degrees, at 2000 metres -12 degrees."
