        "SnowStability": "No change is expected with the remaining snowpack being firm and stable in all locations. Snow lies mainly around coire rims, on steep upper slopes and at the tops of gullies above 950 metres on North to East aspects. The greatest extent is around Coire Ardair and on Creag Meagaidh plateau. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

It was minus 5 Celsius this morning at sea level and minus 1.1 Celsius at 850 metres around midday so we still have inversion conditions affecting the area. Winds backed slightly and were very light from North-North-Easterly direction.",
