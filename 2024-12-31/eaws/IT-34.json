        "comment": "The hard wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Mostly the avalanches are small and can be released in isolated cases even by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
        "highlights": "From a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying. The avalanche prone locations are rather rare."
