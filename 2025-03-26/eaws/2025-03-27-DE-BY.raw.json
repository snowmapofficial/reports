On very steep slopes in all aspects, wet glide-snow avalanches can release naturally over smooth ground. Avalanches tend to be small-sized, but can grow to medium size in isolated cases. In addition, small wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep terrain. Small dry slab avalanches can only be triggered in isolated cases on steep high altitude slopes adjacent to ridgelines in N/E aspects."

Possibility of gliding movements over smooth ground. At high altitudes, a well consolidated old snowpack is blanketed by a few centimeters of loose snow. Isolated fresh small snowdrift are generated. A weak layer can persist near the ground on shady side slopes at highest altitude. In south aspects, the snowpack has become patchy even at high altitude."
