The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas at intermediate and high altitudes. Additionally in isolated cases avalanches can be released in deep layers and reach medium size. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes above approximately 2300 m in little used backcountry terrain. Such avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small and medium-sized natural wet avalanches are to be expected. They can in some cases release the entire snowpack. This applies especially on steep south, southeast and west facing slopes below approximately 2700 m."
