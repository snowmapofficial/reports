Danger spots are found especially in full steep gullies, bowls and slopes. Weak layers within the old snow can be triggered with high additional loads in very few places and lead to small sized slab avalanches. Danger spots are located in very steep shady slopes above 2.000 m. The amount of danger spots increases with altitude."

In steep shady slopes above 2.000 m weak layers of faceted snow are found within the snow base. Partially the snow surface is hard due to strong winds."
