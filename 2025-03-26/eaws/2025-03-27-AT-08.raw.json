On shady steep high-altitude slopes and in ridgeline terrain, small-area snowdrift accumulations require caution. One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution.  On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible."

In high-altitude ridgeilne terrain, small drifts will be generated. Below 1500m there is little snow on the ground. On shady slopes at high and high-alpine altitudes the older drifts lie atop an unfavorable old snowpack, which are often still prone to triggering."

Up to high altitudes the snowpack is most and weakened by rainfall. Gliding movement over smooth ground are possible. South-facing slopes are generally bare of snow."
