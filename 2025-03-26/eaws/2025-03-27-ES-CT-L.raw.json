These can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> As the moisture increases moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can be released by a single winter sport participant or triggered naturally. Some medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at low and intermediate altitudes and on steep sunny slopes. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."
