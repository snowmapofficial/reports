The instabilities within the layers of fresh and drifted snow have largely stabilised.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to 2600 to 2800 m and wet slab avalanches can still occur at these altitudes, as individual weak layers deep in the snowpack are still dry and become substantially less stable when they first become saturated.

The instabilities within the layers of fresh and drifted snow have largely stabilised.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to 2600 to 2800 m and wet slab avalanches can still occur at these altitudes, as individual weak layers deep in the snowpack are still dry and become substantially less stable when they first become saturated.
