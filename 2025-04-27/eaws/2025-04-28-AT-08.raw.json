Backcountry ski tours should be launched early and brought to an end early in the day. In high-altitude ridgeline terrain, small snowdrift accumulations can be prone to triggering from place to place. In high-alpine zones, in addition, seldom-tracked shady slopes in touring terrain require cautious route selection."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The old snowpack is thoroughly wet up to high altitudes. During nights of clear skies, a crust forms on the snowpack surface which is capable of bearing loads, but softens up during the morning. In high-alpine ridgeline terrain, local small-area snowdrift accumulations are evident. In seldom-tracked terrain on shady steep slopes in high-alpine zones, there are unfavorable intermediate layers inside the snowpack. However, there have been no avalanches reported over the last few days."
