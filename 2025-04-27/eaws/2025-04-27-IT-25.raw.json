They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases especially on very steep shady slopes. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m individual mostly small moist and wet avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a rapid increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow."

New snow and wind slabs are lying on a moist old snowpack."
