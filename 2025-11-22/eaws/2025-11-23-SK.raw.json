Occasionally, smaller spontaneous avalanches from new snow are possible. Generally, places where there is older frozen snow under the new snow, or in places with a smoother surface - grass or rock slabs - are more dangerous.",

Under the new snow there is older, frozen snow from about 1800 m above sea level, especially on the northern slopes of the Tatra Mountains. At lower altitudes the new snow fell mostly on grass or bedrock."
