Some showers during the day falling as snow above 8-900m. Winds, Westerly overnight remaining light, then backing through the day from South-Westerly through South and South Easterly then moderate to fresh North-Easterly.\nObserved Weather Influences: A dry and clear day with a freezing level around 900m. Winds light Westerly.\nObservedSnowStability: Rain to summits overnight Friday has affected the snowpack at all elevations. The snowpack is moist to depth and cooling temperatures through the day has helped consolidate and stabilise the snowpack throughout. Instabilities within the snowpack remain present but are diminshing rapidly and the gradually refreezing snow surface presents a stable snowpack on all aspects and altitudes.\r\n The avalanche hazard is Low"
