Old wind slabs at elevated altitudes.","comment":"As the day progresses as the snowfall level rises there will be a gradual increase in the danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized natural avalanches are to be expected in particular on very steep grassy slopes. In the typical avalanche paths the gliding avalanches can in some cases reach low altitudes. In addition the wind slabs in high Alpine regions are prone to triggering in some cases still. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 20 to 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last two days above approximately 1500 m. Up to intermediate altitudes rain will fall on Sunday. These conditions will cause a gradual detrimental transformation of the snowpack as the day progresses in all aspects. In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Temporary decrease in danger of dry and moist avalanches as the precipitation eases.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-11-23T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-11-24T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-11-23"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{"upperBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","S","E","SW","W","SE"]},{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","S","E","SW","W","SE"]}],"bulletinID":"d7ab9d9f-db02-48db-a987-cf593dc6264a","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
