        "comment": "As the day progresses as the snowfall level rises there will be a gradual increase in the danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized natural avalanches are to be expected in particular on very steep grassy slopes. In the typical avalanche paths the gliding avalanches can in some cases reach low altitudes. In addition the wind slabs in high Alpine regions are prone to triggering in some cases still. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
        "highlights": "Gliding avalanches and moist snow slides during the day require caution. Old wind slabs at elevated altitudes."
