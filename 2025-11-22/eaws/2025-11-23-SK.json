        "comment": "Due to snowfall and winds of different directions, new snow is distributed irregularly, so in places where a larger amount is piled up, it is possible to release an avalanche. Occasionally, smaller spontaneous avalanches from new snow are possible. Generally, places where there is older frozen snow under the new snow, or in places with a smoother surface - grass or rock slabs - are more dangerous.",

During the night and the following day (23.11) we expect a further 5 to 10 cm. The snowfall was accompanied by fresh to strong winds with variable direction over the forest belt. Under the new snow there is older, frozen snow from about 1800 m above sea level, especially on the northern slopes of the Tatra Mountains. At lower altitudes the new snow fell mostly on grass or bedrock."
