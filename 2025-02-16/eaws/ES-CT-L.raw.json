The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. Especially above approximately 2300 m the avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones."

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> In some places wind slabs are lying on old snow containing large grains. In some cases the wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
