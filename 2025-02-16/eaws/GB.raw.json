        "Comment": "Caution required in deeper fresh windslab - unstable deposits have become more extensive.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mostly dry with just a trace of snow forecast above 300 metres during the afternoon. Strong South-South-Easterly winds throughout. Freezing level around 400 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will persist in wind sheltered locations on West through North to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Gully tops, sharply defined corrie rims and similar wind sheltered features will be worst affected. Fragile cornices will be present on these aspects. Elsewhere the snow will be shallow or well bonded and wind scoured.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab is rapidly forming in wind sheltered locations on West through North to North-East aspect above 900 metres. Both depth and distribution have increased with features such as gully tops, sharply defined corrie rims and steep convex slopes affected. Fragile cornices are forming on these aspects. Elsewhere the snow is either shallow or well bonded.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
