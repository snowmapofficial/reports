      "comment" : "Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases by winter sport participants in particular in little used terrain. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Avalanches can reach medium size. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from northwesterly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed since Sunday in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines on very steep north and east facing slopes. They are mostly only small but can in some cases be released easily. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

      "comment" : "In the last few days the wind was moderate to strong in the vicinity of peaks. Adjacent to ridgelines on north and east facing slopes mostly small wind slabs formed. These are lying on soft layers. <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes. These can be released in isolated cases. Released avalanches and stability tests have confirmed this situation. Isolated medium-sized slab avalanches have been released by people in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
