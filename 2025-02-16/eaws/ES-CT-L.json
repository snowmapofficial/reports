        "comment": "Faceted weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on little used shady slopes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. Especially above approximately 2300 m the avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones.",

Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
