Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Avalanches can reach medium size. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from northwesterly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed since Sunday in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines on very steep north and east facing slopes. They are mostly only small but can in some cases be released easily. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude.
