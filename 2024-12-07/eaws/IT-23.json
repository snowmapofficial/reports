Fresh wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The new snow and wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, especially on very steep slopes. <br/> In high Alpine regions these avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
