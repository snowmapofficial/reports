Snowdrifts are the major problem, they can trigger small-to-medium sized slab avalanches by minimum addtional loading, e.g. the weight of one single skier. Danger zones occur near to and distant from ridgelines due to strong winds in steep terrain on NW-E-S facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. The frequency of avalanche prone locations tends to increase with ascending altitude. Small glide-snow avalanche on smooth, steep grassy slopes at low and intermediate altitudes and small loosely-packed slies in steep rocky terrain are possible.",
