      "comment" : "Avalanche danger above 2000m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Due to strong winds from varying directions, snowdrift accumulations are being generated, thereby making avalanche prone locations in all aspects, including distant from ridgelines, which are extremely prone to triggering and which can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche even be minimum additional loading. Moreover, in high alpine terrain on purely shady slopes (NW-NE) slab avalanches can be triggered in the old snow and reach medium size. In general, there is still little snow on the ground, danger zones in outlying terrain are often only minimally blanketed by fresh snow."

      "comment" : "Fresh snowdrift accumulations are deposited particularly on shady slopes atop older layers of loose fresh snow and faceted (expansively metamorphosed) crystals. In gullies and bowls at high and high alpine altitudes there are often hardened layers of melt-freeze crusts (September snow) as well as layers of faceted crystals between the hard fundament and the bonded fresh fallen snow from the last days in November. The snowpack is diversely distributed. Below 1800m there is little snow on the ground, fresh fallen snow has fallen on bare ground."

Avalanches will be small-sized. Danger zones occur in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, especially on N-E-S facing slopes. Also in zones distant from ridgelines, small snowdrifts can be prone to triggering. During the course of the day, isolated small loose-snow slides are possible in sunny, steep, rocky and rough terrain. Avalanche prone locations in outlying terrain are often only barely covered. The risks of falling and sustaining injuries need to be considered."
