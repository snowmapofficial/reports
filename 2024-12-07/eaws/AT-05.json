        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2000m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Due to strong winds from varying directions, snowdrift accumulations are being generated, thereby making avalanche prone locations in all aspects, including distant from ridgelines, which are extremely prone to triggering and which can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche even be minimum additional loading. Moreover, in high alpine terrain on purely shady slopes (NW-NE) slab avalanches can be triggered in the old snow and reach medium size. In general, there is still little snow on the ground, danger zones in outlying terrain are often only minimally blanketed by fresh snow.",
