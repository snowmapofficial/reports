        "comment": "As a consequence of a strong wind from northwesterly directions, avalanche prone wind slabs will form. They can be released even by a single winter sport participant above the tree line. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. These are to be avoided in particular in steep terrain.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and weakly bonded old snow represent the main danger. Adjacent to ridgelines the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger."
