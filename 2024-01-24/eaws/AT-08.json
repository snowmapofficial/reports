        "comment": "Fresh snow and snowdrifts are trigger-prone at high altitudes and are easily triggered. Size and frequency of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small-to-medium sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. Backcountry sports require much experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site and prudent route selection; mind the risks of falling. Wet-snow avalanches increasingly possible in steep rocky terrain, can reach medium size. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
