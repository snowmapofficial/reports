        "SnowDistribution": "Deep drifts. Poor visibility above 600 metres. Winds 10 - 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "Stability improving through the day after heavy rain. There aren\\'t many significant cornices in the Glencoe area at present but those that remain will be prone to collapse in the warm, wet conditions.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Very strong South-East winds will veer Southerly and become storm force during the day. Rain, heaviest in the evening and around dawn. The freezing level will be above the summits.",
        "SnowStability": "Wet snow instabilities will be present in areas of recent windslab, mainly on South-West through West to North aspects above 900 metres. Stability will be poorest here during rain in the early evening. The older snowpack will remain generally stable. Any remaining cornices will be prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will continue to consolidate becoming soft in nature. Some minor surface instabilities will be found in the very steepest of locations on South-West to North-West aspects above 800 metres but generally stability will be good.

Stability will become poor, particularly in steeper, wind sheltered locations on South-West through North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Gully exits and corrie rims will be especially affected. Elsewhere, wet snow instabilities will be possible on any steep terrain with cornice remnants  prone to collapse.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "There is a new shallow covering of soft snow on most aspects above 600 metres. Windslab has formed in wind sheltered locations mainly on South-West to North-West aspects above 900 metres with lessor amounts noted on Northerly aspects.

        "Comment": "Freezing level is expected to rise to around twice summit height, with heavy rain overnight. All existing snowpacks, recent and older, where found, will experience high instability throughout the period. Sluffing and full depth slides of snow from steep crag ledges and slopes is possible.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be heavy rain overnight, to all levels, which will ease slightly, to showers through Saturday. Freezing level will be well above the summits throughout the period. Winds will increase steadily through the day from Gale force to Storm force and veer from South-Easterly to become Southerly.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight and into Saturday morning there will be a period of increased instability due to the heavy rain and rising temperatures. This will affect recent windslab on South-West to North-West aspects, as well as the older snowpack on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Any remaining cornices will be prone to collapse, and full depth avalanches on extremely steep, slopes and crag ledges are possible.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The overnight snow faded out during the day to light occasional showers, which were of rain to the tops by midday. After a cold night, the freezing level rose rapidly during the morning to above summit levels. Winds were fresh East South-Easterly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "There were some isolated accumulations of fresh windslab on Westerly aspects that were moderatly well bonded. These have lost some stability in the rising temperatures through the day. The surface of the older snowpack on steep North to East slopes above 900 metres is softening.\r\nThe avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will thaw at all altitudes.  In areas of steep terrain, wet snow instabilities will affect many aspects.
