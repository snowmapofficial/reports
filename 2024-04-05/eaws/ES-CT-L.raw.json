      "comment" : "From early morning a dangerous avalanche situation will be encountered over a wide area. As the penetration by moisture increases moist and wet avalanches are to be expected, even medium-sized ones. Avalanches can be released by people or triggered naturally. In particular at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for defensive route selection. Backcountry tours should be started and concluded very early."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The avalanche conditions remain spring-like. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be severely restricted. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to rapid moistening of the snowpack in all aspects also at elevated altitudes. The sometimes storm force wind will transport only a little snow. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
