On north-facing slopes above 2200 m the snowpack will be thoroughly wet for the first time on Saturday. The stable snowpack means that most avalanches will be glide-snow avalanches and loose wet-snow avalanches. Wet slab avalanches are more likely where there is little snow and in rocky terrain. Due to the loss of firmness of the snowpack, the glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches can sweep lots of wet snow along in their plummet path."
