Most of the high-altitude measuring stations along the Main Alpine Ridge are showing record snow depths for early April. At intermediate altitudes, snow depths are mostly below average in the north and above average in the south. There is still some snow on the flat measuring fields below 1500 m, especially in the Gotthard region.</p><p>Sometimes strong westerly winds have led to the formation of wind slabs in recent days. Some of these are still prone to triggering, especially at high altitudes. Isolated avalanche fractures in deeper layers of the snowpack were observed over the Easter weekend in southern Valais, central Grisons and Engadine. Along both the northern and the southern flanks of the Alps, there are hardly any weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>The snowpack has become thoroughly wet below approximately 2200 m, and up to around 3000 m on south-facing slopes under the new snow. As a result of the considerable warming and the solar radiation, there is an increased possibility of moist snow slides and avalanches. There is also more of a possibility of gliding avalanches again. These may become large, and in the regions with a lot of snow in the south, occasionally very large.</p>"

Most of the high-altitude measuring stations along the Main Alpine Ridge are showing record snow depths for early April. At intermediate altitudes, snow depths are mostly below average in the north and above average in the south. There is still some snow on the flat measuring fields below 1500 m, especially in the Gotthard region.</p><p>Sometimes strong westerly winds have led to the formation of wind slabs in recent days. Some of these are still prone to triggering, especially at high altitudes. Isolated avalanche fractures in deeper layers of the snowpack were observed over the Easter weekend in southern Valais, central Grisons and Engadine. Along both the northern and the southern flanks of the Alps, there are hardly any weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>The snowpack has become thoroughly wet below approximately 2200 m, and up to around 3000 m on south-facing slopes under the new snow. As a result of the considerable warming and the solar radiation, there is an increased possibility of moist snow slides and avalanches. There is also more of a possibility of gliding avalanches again. These may become large, and in the regions with a lot of snow in the south, occasionally very large.</p>"
