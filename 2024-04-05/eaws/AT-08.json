        "comment": "Due to striking rise in temperatures and solar radiation, avalanche danger will increase from moderate in the morning to considerable. During the course of the day, esp. on sunny slopes but also in shady terrain, increasingly frequent wet-snow avalanches can be expected. Wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can grow to medium size in starting zones where there is enough snow, releases can grow large and endanger exposed areas. Small-to-medium slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection and should be terminated early in the day. Near-surface layers of the old snowpack are triggerable mostly by large additional loading. ",
