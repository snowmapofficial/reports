Otherwise, avalanches may still be triggered in places in the west and north in older, near-surface layers of the snowpack.</p><p>In southern Valais, Grisons and Ticino, there are weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack. In these regions, avalanches may be triggered in places in the fresh and somewhat older drifted snow, and in some cases may also sweep away deeper layers of the snowpack. Isolated avalanches may also be triggered directly in deep layers, especially in the Engadine and south of there.</p><p>Gliding avalanches, some large, are still possible.</p>"
