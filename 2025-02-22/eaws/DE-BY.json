        "comment": "In early morning the snowpack is compact, often frozen hard, and largely stable. Due to daytime warming it softens up rapidly during the day. The snowpack is then moist on the surface, forfeiting firmness, in some places it is utterly wet. On shady slopes the snow is also increasingly moist on the surface. Only at high altitudes is the loose snow still dry. Snowpack analysis and snow profiles show good snowpack stability by and large. On south-facing slopes the ground is becoming bare of snow."
