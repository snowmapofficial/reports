Frequency and size of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. The snowdrifts can be triggered as a small slab avalanche. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and being forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is still difficult to assess. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
