The mostly shallow wind slabs of the last few days have bonded quite well with the old snowpack. They are unlikely to be released now. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface has a crust that is barely capable of bearing a load. The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to gradual softening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. This also applies at low and intermediate altitudes in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
