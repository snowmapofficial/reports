      "comment" : "Weak layers in the old snow can be triggered in isolated cases by one sole skier on steep W/N/E facing slopes above 2300m. Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, releases can reach medium size. Due to northerly winds, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations were generated in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape. They can be triggered by one sole skier in the weak old snow, esp. on NW/N/E facing slopes above 2200m. Danger zones are generally small-sized. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. On very steep sunny slopes, daytime warmth and solar radiation makes mostly small wet loose-snow avalanches possible in isolated cases."

The fresh snowdrift accumulations lie deposited atop an unfavorable old snowpack surface in high-alpine zones. Sunshine and higher temperatures during the daytime moisten the snowpack. Highly varied snow depths, depending on wind impact. There is too little snow on the ground for this juncture of the season."
