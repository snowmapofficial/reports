The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible."

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from the middle of the day to increasing moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> In particular shady slopes and high altitudes: Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist in the snowpack. In some cases the wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
