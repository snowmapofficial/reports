        "comment": "Weak layers in the old snow can be triggered in isolated cases by one sole skier on steep W/N/E facing slopes above 2300m. Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, releases can reach medium size. Due to northerly winds, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations were generated in gullies, bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape. They can be triggered by one sole skier in the weak old snow, esp. on NW/N/E facing slopes above 2200m. Danger zones are generally small-sized. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. On very steep sunny slopes, daytime warmth and solar radiation makes mostly small wet loose-snow avalanches possible in isolated cases.",
