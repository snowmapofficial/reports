        "comment": "The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads, in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible.",
        "highlights": "Weakly bonded old snow at high altitude. The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable."

In some cases the wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
