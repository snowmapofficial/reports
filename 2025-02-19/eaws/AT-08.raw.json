Frequency and size of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. The snowdrifts can be triggered as a small slab avalanche. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and being forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is still difficult to assess. Caution urged below glide cracks."

In high altitude pass and rigeline zones, small fresh, often trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, esp. on steep shady slopes these drifts have been deposited. On sunny slopes the most recent snowfall is already moist and is forming a melt-freeze crust. During the daytime hours, this crust softens up again."
