On west-facing slopes the fresh drifts lie deposited atop surface hoar. Both of these are potential weak layers. The old snowpack beneath them is compact, without marked weak layers."

Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain, at entries into gullies and bowls and behind discontinuities. Wherever the snow is bonded like a slab, medium-sized avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person. Frequency of danger zones increases with ascending altitude.\r\nIn all aspects, isolated naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches can be expected. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",
