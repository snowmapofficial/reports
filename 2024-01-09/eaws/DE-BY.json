Fresh snowdrifts are the main problem. Avalanche prone locations occur esp. in steep ridgeline terrain on S/W/N facing locations and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as medium-sized slab avalanches even by minimal additional loading.\r\nIn addition, isolated glide snow avalanches can be expected esp. on very steep slopes with a smooth ground beneath in all aspects - natural triggering is possible. Glide cracks are covered, thus, hard to spot. At higher altitudes these releases can reach medium size.\r\nOn the sunny side spontaneously releasing superficial loose snow avalanches (mostly small) in extremely steep terrain can be expected. ",
