        "comment": "Weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack can be released by people on shady slopes. In these aspects the avalanches are medium-sized. Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant at intermediate and high altitudes. The avalanches are rather small. Medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended.",
