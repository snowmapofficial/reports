Slab avalanches can be triggered on many slopes at higher altitudes even with a small additional load. Danger spots can be found in steep terrain of all exposures. Avalanches can tear through deeper layers and reach medium size. From extremely steep terrain, fresh snow can detach itself as a small or medium-sized loose snow avalanche.\n\nOn very steep, smooth meadow slopes and in patchy mountain forests, smaller sliding snow avalanches can also detach themselves.",

At higher altitudes, there are widespread weak intermediate layers in the upper half metre of the snow cover. These can be detected with snow cover tests. Older accumulations of drift snow lying on soft layers are covered by loose powder snow. In areas exposed to the wind, the snow can be bound together like boards. This is the only place where breakage is to be expected over larger areas. The ground is not frozen and the base of the snowpack is often wet."
