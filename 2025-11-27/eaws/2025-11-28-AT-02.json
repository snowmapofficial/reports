They are covered with new snow and are difficult to recognise. Avalanches can in isolated cases be released in near-ground layers also. Such avalanche prone locations are rare but are barely recognisable. In steep gullies avalanches can in some cases reach medium size. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
