In these aspects the avalanches are medium-sized. Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant at intermediate and high altitudes. The avalanches are rather small. Medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted. <br/> <br/> On Friday it will be partly cloudy. <br/> Especially low and intermediate altitudes,: The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. <br/> In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The avalanche activity will slowly increase.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-11-28T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-11-29T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-11-28"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2100"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","E"]},{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","SW","SE","S","E","W"]},{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["SW","SE","S","E","W"]}],"bulletinID":"e6929461-468a-4535-8b9f-344ddcd1f034","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
