Due to rainfall below 2600m, isolated mostly small wet-snow avalanches are possible, esp. alng the Salzburg border. Due to fresh snow and moderate-velocity winds, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations will be generated over the course of the day which can be triggered by one sole skier, but will be mostly small-sized releases. Caution urged in gullies and bowls and behind protruberances in the terrain along the Salzburg border.Danger zones occur above 2600m. Isolated danger zones occur also on sunny slopes in high-alpine zones."

Due to fresh snow and moderate-to-strong northerly winds, small snowdrift accumulations have been generated, they lie deposited on shady slopes near ridgelines above 2600m atop soft layers. Below 2600m: the old snowpack is wet. The surface can hardly freeze at night and rapidly softens in morning, esp. along the Salzburg border following a night of overcast skies. Below 2200m hardly any snow on the ground."
