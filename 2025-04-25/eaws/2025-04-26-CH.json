In the south in particular, the northerly wind transported the new snow intensely at times. The instabilities within the layers of new and drifted snow are stabilising rapidly. However, as a consequence of solar radiation, wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected on Saturday, especially in the north.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to between 2600 and 2800 m. Particularly in the inneralpine regions of Grisons, fractures in the old snowpack are still possible at this altitude when weak layers initially become moist.</p>"

Before the snowfall, the surface of the snowpack was still dry and loose in places only on northern slopes in the high Alpine regions. In the south in particular, the northerly wind transported the new snow intensely at times. The instabilities within the layers of new and drifted snow are stabilising rapidly. However, as a consequence of solar radiation, wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected on Saturday, especially in the north.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to between 2600 and 2800 m. Particularly in the inneralpine regions of Grisons, fractures in the old snowpack are still possible at this altitude when weak layers initially become moist.</p>"
