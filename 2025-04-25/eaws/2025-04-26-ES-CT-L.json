        "comment": "In all aspects more frequent small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible from early morning. This applies in particular at intermediate altitudes, in particular in the southernmost and easternmost part of Aran. <br/> <br/> Above approximately 2000 m: As a consequence of the precipitation more dry avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. These can in some places be released, even by a single winter sport participant. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information about the snowpack, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
