Avalanche prone locations occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts, In isolated cases, small glide-snow avalanches are also possible. A cautious route selection is recommended. During the course of the day due to solar radiation and higher daytime temperatures, increasingly frequent moist slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible where snowfall has been heavier."
