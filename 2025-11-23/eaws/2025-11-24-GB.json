Heavy and persistent snow is expected during the morning becoming more showery in the afternoon.\nObserved Weather Influences: Winds fresh to strong at first with drifting snow at summit levels. Winds easing during the  afternoon becoming Easterly.\r\nFreezing level hovered around summit level. Very poor visibility above 900m. Snow showers above 1000m.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack has continued to consolidate and stabilise in all areas above 950m, softer but stable below this level. Some new snow and drifting has formed new thin windslab on West to North-Westerly aspects above 1000m. Accumulations are mostly shallow but where any depth is achieved in wind sheltered places they are rapidly stabilising in the milder temperatures.   The avalanche hazard is Low"
