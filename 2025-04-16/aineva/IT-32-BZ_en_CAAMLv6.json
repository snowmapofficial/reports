Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes natural avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. This applies in particular in case of releases originating from very steep high-altitude starting zones that still retain some snow. These can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases in the regions with a lot of snow. In some cases, the avalanches can reach areas without any snow cover in steep gullies. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs will form above approximately 2800 m. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on very steep shady slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. <br/> <br/> The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring."

On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is now lying. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: 15 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall. From the Ortler Range via the Ultental to the Timmelsjoch and along the border with Veneto up to 50 cm of snow will fall. As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, further wind slabs will form. These are lying on soft layers on steep shady slopes."
