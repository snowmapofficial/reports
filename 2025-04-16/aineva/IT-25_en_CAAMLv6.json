Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m more frequent wet slab avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. These can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size also in the regions with a lot of snow. <br/> Fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring."

Some fresh snow and in particular the mostly small wind slabs that are forming at high altitude will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on east to north to west facing aspects above approximately 2600 m."
