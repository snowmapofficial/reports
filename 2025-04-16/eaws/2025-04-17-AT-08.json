On steep slopes in all aspects which have not yet discharged, wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally and grow to medium-to-large size. In high-alpine zones, fresh snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, they are usually small, but often easily triggered. Danger zones occur in gullies, bowls, behind protruberances in the terrain and on very steep shady slopes above 2800m. In addition, winter sports enthusiasts can trigger small-to-medium avalanches in the old snow in isolated cases. Danger zones occur in little-tracked backcountry terrain, mostly on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize.",
