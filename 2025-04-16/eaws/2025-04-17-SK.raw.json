      "comment" : "Moderate avalanche danger in the high Tatras and Low Tatras (above 1800 m above sea level), level 2. Due to previous rain and warming, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward areas of the highest altitudes are dangerous, where larger amounts of newer drifted snow are concentrated. Avalanches can be triggered here, especially with higher additional loads, but spontaneous avalanches and small avalanches from wet snow can also occur. Care should also be taken on the cornices in the upper parts of the ridges. On isolated steep slopes with grassy subsoils, gliding (base) avalanches may also occur.",
