        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate wind from northerly directions, soft wind slabs formed adjacent to ridgelines. As a consequence of the sometimes strong wind they will increase in size appreciably as the day progresses. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in shady places that are protected from the wind. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized and easily released. <br/> <br/> Especially sunny slopes and low altitudes: As the moisture increases small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist snow slides are to be expected as the day progresses. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is recommended.",
