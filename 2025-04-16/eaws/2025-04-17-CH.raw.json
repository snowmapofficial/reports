On northern slopes, water saturation is under way up to altitudes of around 2400 m.</p><p>With large volumes of fresh snow and southeasterly winds, large snowdrift accumulations are forming above around 2500 m. This overlying snow can be expected to cause fractures in the old snowpack, in particular on northern slopes. This is especially the case in southern Valais, Ticino and in some regions of Grisons, where there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack, but also in isolated cases in other regions.</p><p>Precipitation will be exceptionally heavy from Wednesday to Thursday midday in those regions most exposed to precipitation, causing a rapid increase in avalanche risk, especially overnight to Thursday.</p>"},"tendency":[{"comment":"<h1>Outlook</h1><p>Temperatures will fall on Good Friday and there will be little precipitation. There will be sunny intervals in the west and still mostly cloudy conditions in the east. Winds will drop significantly. The risk of dry avalanches will decrease. However, the situation is likely to remain critical for snow sports participants. The risk of wet avalanches will also decrease, although moist and wet avalanches from the fresh snow are to be expected, especially in the west, with higher daytime temperatures and sunshine.</p><p>On Easter Saturday, conditions will be mainly overcast in the south, but there will be little precipitation. In the north, conditions will be mostly sunny and milder again. There will be light to moderate winds from southerly directions.
