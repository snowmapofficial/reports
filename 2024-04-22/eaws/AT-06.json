The old snowpack is thoroughly moist, was able to consolidate through the lower temperatures this last week. The fresh snow is well bonded with the snowpack. Due to solar radiation, diffuse light and high air moisture the snowpack can forfeit its cohesion during the day and trigger loose-snow avalanches naturally. The snowdrift problem has receded."
