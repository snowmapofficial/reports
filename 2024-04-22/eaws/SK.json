        "comment": "In the Tatras and Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) at altitudes above 1700 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is the new snow that has fallen in the last 3 days. Narrow couloirs, leeward sides of ridges and places under rock walls where there is a larger amount of new snow are dangerous. Due to the changing wind, the dangerous places are in different orientations. The release of slab avalanches is possible with large additional loads on steep slopes. In the afternoon, with warming temperatures and sunshine, smaller to medium-sized spontaneous avalanches of wet snow may occur on steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "Be careful on steep slopes with larger amount of new snow. Expect wet spontaneous avalanches on sunlit slopes in the afternoon."

It is unevenly distributed due to changing strong winds. Wind-exposed positions with old snow are mostly hard to icy, and conversely, on leeward slopes there is a layer of new snow of varying quality from loose to wind-drifted snow. During the day (Tuesday 23.4) it will warm up slightly, and in the afternoon the snow cover will become moist and even wet on sunlit slopes, with a possible wet avalanche."
