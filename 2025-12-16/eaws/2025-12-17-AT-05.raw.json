In shady high altitudes, there are still isolated spots in the old snow that are difficult to trigger for small slab avalanches, especially in gullies and hollows close to the crest. Overall, however, the risk of injury from terrain traps and stones predominates."

These were partially deposited on a loose old snow surface in shady high altitudes. There, small avalanches can be triggered by individual people in blown-in areas, i.e. mainly behind ridges and in gullies and hollows. In the high Alps, this can also affect eastern and western slopes. In these areas, weak layers can occasionally still be found in the old snow."

The snow depth is well below average, on the south side there is hardly any snow up to high altitudes."
