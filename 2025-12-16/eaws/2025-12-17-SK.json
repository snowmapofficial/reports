        "comment": "In all mountain ranges where there is still a continuous snow cover (High, Low, Western Tatras) there is a low avalanche danger. The snow cover has stabilised due to temperature changes. Due to the inversion, high temperatures persist even at the highest altitudes, causing wet snow during the day, but due to cloud cover this problem will not be as pronounced as during the weekend and Monday. Spontaneous wet avalanches from warming temperatures may occur.",
        "highlights": "Inversion causes warm weather even at the highest elevations, watch out for wet snow."

        "comment": "The weather development of the last few days caused daytime melting and nighttime freezing of the snow cover. This has resulted in a hard firn and frozen surface of the snow cover, which is stable. It may gradually soften during the day. A continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1200 m and reaches 50 to 80 cm at the highest altitudes. In the Western and High Tatras there is snow from about 1500 m above sea level and its height is only up to 50 cm."
