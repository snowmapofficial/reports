Winds will be from the South-South-West backing to the South overnight reaching storm force by dawn, and decreasingly slightly to become gale force by the end of the period. The freezing level will be 800 metres overnight, rising to 2600 metres by midday.\nObserved Weather Influences: A generally dry day with just a trace of snow on the western boundary of the Northern Cairngorms area. The freezing level was around 900 metres, with frozen ground from 600 metres upwards. Winds were mostly from the South-West, strong to gale force in strength.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack is very firm, well bonded and stable. The greatest extents remain in areas such as coire back walls, ridge flanks and plateau areas above 1000 metres. Elsewhere, firm snow patches also remain in isolated depressions surrounded by bare ground. The avalanche hazard is Low."
