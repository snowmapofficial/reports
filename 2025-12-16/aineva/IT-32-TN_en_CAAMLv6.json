Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m.

This applies especially on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. The wind slabs are mostly shallow and prone to triggering. These are clearly recognisable. Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."
