During the last period of snowfall, the past two days, up to 15 to 20 cm of new snow fell very locally. Strong northerly winds are expected on the mountains above the forest belt, which will transport this snow to the leeward slopes of southern orientations. Along with further snowfall, up to 10 cm, unstable snow slabs and pillows will form. Mainly under saddles, rock walls, in moguls and steep couloirs. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads.",
