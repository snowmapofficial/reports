The newer snowdrift accumulations are sometimes prone to triggering. These are largest on the northern flank of the Alps and in Grisons, which had the most transportable snow.</p><p>The old snowpack is quite favourable in the north, but in southern Valais and Grisons, it is faceted and is sometimes prone to triggering, especially in the Engadine and Val M\u00fcstair. In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to around 3000 m and on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2200 to 2400 m.</p><p>With the good outgoing longwave radiation in the west and south and the rather low temperatures, the wet snowpack stabilises during the night. With the daytime consequences of warming and solar radiation, the danger of wet and gliding avalanches increases somewhat.</p>"
