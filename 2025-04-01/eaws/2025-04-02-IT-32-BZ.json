These can be released by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised in particular on steep slopes above approximately 2200 m. As a consequence of the solar radiation, the likelihood of slab avalanches being released will increase in particular on steep sunny slopes. <br/> Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released by individual winter sport participants. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes above approximately 2200 m and on steep, little used west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent loose snow avalanches are to be expected, even medium-sized ones, in the regions exposed to a lot of new snow in particular on extremely steep slopes. <br/> <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m.",
