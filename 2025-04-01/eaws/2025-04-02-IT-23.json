They can be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. Especially in the areas bordering Piedmont most affected by the rainfall. In these regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. Here the avalanches can be released naturally. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes above approximately 2500 m in places that are protected from the wind.",
