Some of these snowdrift accumulations are prone to triggering. In addition, the more recent snowdrift accumulations on the northern flank of the Alps and in Grisons are also still prone to triggering. These are largest in the places which had the most transportable snow.</p><p>The old snowpack is quite favourable in the north. In southern Valais and Grisons the old snowpack is faceted and sometimes prone to triggering, especially in the Engadine and Val M\u00fcstair. In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to around 3000 m and on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2200 to 2400 m.</p><p>With good outgoing longwave radiation in the north, the wet snowpack stabilises during the night. With the daytime consequences of warming and solar radiation, the danger of wet and gliding avalanches increases somewhat.</p>"
