Danger zones where slab avalanches can be triggered even by one sole skier occur in steep ridgeline terrain on N/E/S-facing slopes, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, and behind protruberances in the terrain. Frequency of danger zones increases with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can grow to medium size. In addition, the fresh snow can trigger as a loose-snow avalanche in rocky or extremely steep terrain. At higher altitudes, loose-snow avalanches can reach medium size. Small glide-snow avalanches can be expected more frequently on steep grass-covered slopes, also on slopes which were bare of snow prior to the current snowfall. Isolated small loose-snow avalanches of fresh fallen snow are possible in steep rocky terrain."
