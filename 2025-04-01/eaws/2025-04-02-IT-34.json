        "comment": "Fresh wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, especially adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects. Sometimes avalanches are medium-sized. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. Small and medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible as the moisture increases. This applies in particular on steep slopes above the tree line. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Weak layers in the old snowpack are treacherous. In addition there is a danger of moist avalanches."

        "comment": "In some localities 0 to 2 cm of snow has fallen above approximately 2000 m. As a consequence of a sometimes strong wind from northerly directions, wind slabs formed especially adjacent to ridgelines. The wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used west, north and east facing slopes."
