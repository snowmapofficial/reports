These can be released by small loads or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent small moist avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones."

      "comment" : "Over a wide area 20 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the past few hours above approximately 1800 m. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
