        "Summary": "TO for 17/2  Snowpack thawing and diminishing. Good stability. Low hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack, most snow remains around coire rims and in gullies above 750 metres. Cloudy in the glens with some clearer spells on the summits particularly in the morning. Winds 10mph or less.",
        "Comment": "Mild conditions continue through the weekend. Slightly colder on Monday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild conditions will continue with the freezing level above all summits. Dry overnight and during the morning with rain at all levels developing during the afternoon. Moderate South-Easterly winds will increase to strong through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The remaining snowpack will continue to thaw and diminish. Snowpack stability will be good in all locations. Greatest accumulations will remain around coire rims and in gullies, mostly on North through East to South-East aspects above 750 metres. Snow cover becoming increasingly patchy elsewhere. The avalanche hazard will be Low",

        "SnowDistribution": "Moist thawing snowpack in all locations, most snow on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Calm, very light South-Westerly winds. Some clouds over the summits but visibility generally good.",
        "Comment": "Remaining mild, a weak ridge of high pressure will keep winds generally light and conditions dry.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will continue to remain above the summits through the period. A dry morning with the possibility of light showers in the afternoon these maybe sleet on the highest summits. The light South-Easterly winds will strengthen becoming strong South-South-Easterly.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to slowly thaw but should remain generally well bonded. Isolated wet snow instabilities may exist on steeper slopes, mainly on North to East aspects above 950 metres. Areas most affected will be around steep gully tops and coire rims. At lower levels the spring snowpack will continue to thaw and diminish. Any remaining cornices will be prone to collapse.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

The greatest snow accumulations are on North to Easterly aspects above 900 metres. At lower elevations the snow cover is  soft and is slowly depleting. Any remaining cornices are soft and unstable.

        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will fluctuate around the summits, before rising to above the summits at dawn, peaking at 2400 metres around midday. Light winds, mainly from the South-South-East will increase to very strong by the end of the day. Negligible amounts of rain expected in late afternoon.",
