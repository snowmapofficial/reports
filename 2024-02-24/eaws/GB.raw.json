        "Comment": "Looking reasonably settled over the next couple of days. Good winter walking conditions.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be a largely dry, part cloudy day, but thickening cloud late afternoon may bring a few flakes of snow. Light Southerly winds initially will gradually back North and freshen through the day. The freezing level will rise to around 600 metres by the end of the period.",
        "SnowStability": "In general, the snow cover will be stable, shallow and mainly lie on bare ground. However, weaknesses will persist in deeper pockets of windslab that remain in steep locations, largely above 800 metres on North to East aspects. Terrain most affected will be tops of gullies, coire rims and ridge flanks, particularly where the windslab overlies firm old snow. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

However, isolated weaknesses exist in deposits of windslab, on steep, previously wind sheltered terrain, primarily around summit levels on North to East aspects, most notably, where the windslab overlies firm old snow.
