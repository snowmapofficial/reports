        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate wind from easterly directions, further wind slabs will form on Sunday in some cases. In the last two days sometimes easily released wind slabs formed at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. These avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. They are to be found in particular on steep northwest, north and southeast facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and exist in all aspects. Avalanches are rather small but can be released even by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Additionally in isolated cases avalanches can also be released in the old snowpack and reach medium size in isolated cases, in particular on very steep northwest, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation individual small gliding avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",

        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate wind from easterly directions, further wind slabs will form on Sunday in some cases. In the last two days sometimes easily released wind slabs formed at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. These avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. They are to be found in particular on steep northwest, north and southeast facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and exist in all aspects. Avalanches are rather small but can be released even by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Additionally in isolated cases avalanches can also be released in the old snowpack and reach medium size in isolated cases, in particular on very steep northwest, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation individual small gliding avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
        "highlights": "The sometimes new snow-covered wind slabs represent the main danger. Avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow."
