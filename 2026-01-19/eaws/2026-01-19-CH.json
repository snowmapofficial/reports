On the southern flank of the Alps, the fresh snow from Friday and Saturday was deposited on top of an equally weak snowpack.&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible for medium and large-sized avalanches to be triggered in the old snowpack over a wide area. The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes in Valais and northern Grisons is particularly prone to triggering. Avalanches may also be triggered in the old snowpack on the northern flank of the Alps.
