Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations can be found at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes."

The snowpack base here consists of faceted crystals. Up to medium elevations, the snow surface is dominated by partly stable crust and thin breakable crust at higher elevations. On the sunny slopes, it is frozen hard in the morning and firns up during the daytime changes. At the highest elevations, some fresh wind slab could develop on a small scale. The snow depths are below average."
