Slab avalanches can be triggered in some places even with little additional load and can reach medium size when breaking through the persistent weak layer. The danger areas are located in particular in the north-west to east aspects behind ridgelines and terrain edges as well as in the entrance areas to steep gullies and bowls. In particular, transitions from a little to a lot of snow and the edges of fresh and older snow packs should be avoided."

Fresh and older drift snow packs form the snow slab on the existing weak layers and are prone to triggering. On the sunny slopes, the snow cover, snowpack is mostly settled and quite compact. On the sunny slopes, the slopes in some regions are bare up to 2000 metres."
