Especially transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places by winter sport participants. Sometimes the avalanches are dangerously large. <br/> <br/> The new snow of Monday can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. More dry snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. Some medium-sized avalanches are nontheless not ruled out. <br/> As a consequence of warming moist snow slides are to be expected from the early morning. <br/> <br/> At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience and great restraint.",
