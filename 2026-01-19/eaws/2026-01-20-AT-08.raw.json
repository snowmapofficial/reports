Danger zones are located expecially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers. In addition, as a result of foehn-wind impact, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been genearted particularly in ridgline and pass areas."

Settling noises, fractures in the surface and avalanache releases continue to confirm the ongoing proneness to triggering of the snowpack. As a result of intermittently strong southerly winds, fresh snowdrifts have accumulated particularly in high-altitude ridgeline and pass areas; these are deposited atop a loose old snowpack base on shady high-altitude slopes and are prone to triggering."

These were deposited on shady high altitude slopes top loosely-packed old snow and are prone to triggering. Bonding of the fresh snow and drifts from last week to the often faceted, expansively metamorphosed old snowpack surface and unfavorably structured layers inside the snowpack is only moderate-to-poor from place to place. As a result of mild temperatures, the snow at low and intermediate altitudes is moist and the surface is melt-freeze encrusted in early morning. At low altitudes there is little snow on the ground."
