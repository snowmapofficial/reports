      "comment" : "The avalanche danger increases rapidly and is considerable above 2000 metres and low below. Slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by low additional loads and can reach medium size. Both fresh and older drift snowpacks as well as the weakly built-up old snowpack can be disturbed, whereby fractures can tear through. Avalanche prone locations are found in north-west, north to east facing steep terrain, but also in the southern sector and generally next to blown-off areas. They increase rapidly above the tree line. Remote triggering is possible, drifting snow areas should be avoided on a large scale. Whumpfing collapsing sounds can indicate danger. Terrain traps are less full due to a lack of snow and are therefore more effective."

      "comment" : "Under the influence of mild air and sunlight, the snow cover, snowpack has settled and become cardboardy up to around 2000 metres. It has at least a thin melt-freeze crust in the morning. The transition from fresh and slightly older windslab snow to the old snowpack (faceted crystals on/under the crust) usually serves as a weak layer. Deeper in the persistent weak layer are further weak layers of faceted crystals and deep rime, often in the vicinity of crusts. Ridges and ridges are often completely blown off."
