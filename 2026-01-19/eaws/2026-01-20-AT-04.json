In areas adjacent to the ridgeline, at crossings, behind terrain edges and in steep bowls and gullies, slab avalanches of up to medium size can still be triggered in places, especially in the northern and eastern sectors, even with little additional load. Despite strong southerly winds at times, there are hardly any fresh loads, but if there are, be aware of them.",

Easily recognisable weak layers are present in the form of faceted crystals without bindings and/or floating snow. Higher up, there may be fresh, small-scale but easily disturbed drifts. In general, there is little snow and the snow cover, snowpack is very unevenly distributed. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."

The sun will shine brightly and visibility will be excellent in the dry air. At first, moderately strong winds from the east to south, but in the afternoon the wind will mostly be light. Temperatures at 1500 m around 2 degrees, at 2000 m around -2 degrees."
