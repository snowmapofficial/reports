        "comment": "Avalanche danger above the treeline is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main problem: freshly generated snowdrifts. Danger zones occur near ridges on N/E/S facing sloes, in gullies, bowls. Slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole person, releases usually small, the danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow.\r\nIn addition, the fresh snow at 1400-1800 m becomes moist during the day and can slide/glide in extremely steep terrain. Mind the risks of taking a fall.\r\nGliding snow is the main problem. On very steep slopes with smooth ground and grass-covered terrain and forest clearances, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night. Avoid zones beneath glide cracks.",
