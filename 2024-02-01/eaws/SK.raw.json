Under mechanical loading, the stress in this snow layer spreads well, so that slab avalanches are possible on very steep slopes, especially with large additional loads (movement on foot, or multiple skiers/snowboarders close together)."

      "comment" : "The snow cover is blown to a hard base of ice on the windward, westerly sides due to the very windy weekend, in places down to the grass. Conversely, the leeward moguls and gullies have a large amount of wind-blown snow deposited in slabs and pillows. These lie on a hard icy surface with which they are not well bonded.\nThe previous warming and the subsequent slight cooling have partially stabilised the layers in the snow cover, yet wind-blown snow formations are still dangerous on very steep slopes.\nA cold front passed through our area on Thursday afternoon, bringing northwesterly winds and slight cooling again. Only up to 2cm of new snow was recorded in our mountains."
