        "comment": "As a result of fresh snow and strong NW winds, mostly small but trigger-prone snowdrift accumulations have been generated. Near-surface layers and older drifts are still prone to triggering, increasingly so with ascending altitude. Such danger zones occur mostly in transitions from shallow to deeper snow or on heavily wind-loaded slopes. Avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading and grow to medium size. Backcountry sports require prudent route selection.  Caution urged near cornices. The situation is more critical at high altitudes, loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. in steep sunny and rocky tererain. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
