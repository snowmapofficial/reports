Avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. Small and medium-sized avalanches are possible. <br/> Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized natural avalanches are possible in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released on shady slopes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size."
