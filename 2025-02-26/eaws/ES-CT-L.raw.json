      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from variable directions, avalanche prone wind slabs formed by the early morning in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as above the tree line. Mostly they are small and in some cases easily released. Released avalanches and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate poor snowpack stability on wind-loaded slopes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. Caution is to be exercised in particular on wind-loaded slopes at the border to France, at the border to Ribagorça and Pallars and at the border to Benasque."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since yesterday above approximately 1500 m. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. The new snow and wind slabs are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack on wind-protected shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. Faceted weak layers exist in the top section of the old snowpack especially on steep, little used shady slopes. The solar radiation gave rise on Wednesday to slight moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes. On Thursday it will be cloudy. The surface of the snowpack will hardly soften at all. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying."
