        "comment": "In all mountains there is only LOW avalanche danger (level 1). The situation is stable, the older snow cover is melted and hardened. We expect a change after a longer period without precipitation. Up to 10 cm of new snow will fall in the afternoon and evening. It will fall without significant wind influence. Avalanche release is only exceptionally possible above the forest belt - on very steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "Generally favourable avalanche situation. Watch out for new snow."

New snow has fallen mainly at high altitudes above 1 500 m above sea level. It is not cohesive with the hard ground. In the northern shady troughs and moguls locally dry powder snow up to 20cm. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice covered with newer snow."
