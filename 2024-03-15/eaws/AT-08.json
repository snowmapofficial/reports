Danger zones occur near ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small-to-medium slab avalanches and also loose-snow avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In high-alpine regions the situation is more crditical. Due to solar radiation and rising daytime temperatures, wet slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. on very steep rocky slopes. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger at any time of day or night and grow to larger size.",

Nocturnal outgoing radiation is reduced.\u00a0A breakable crust generally forms at nigh, then softens during the daytime. Below 1500 m there is little snow on the ground."
