        "Summary": "GC 16/3 limited new snow amounts forecast. Old snowpack firm, icy and stable exists mainly on N to E aspects above 850m. Av Haz Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Very little snow below 750 metres on any aspect, greatest snow accumulations remain on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 850m. Predominately dry, cloudy over the summits in the morning, much brighter conditions in the afternoon. Moderate to Fresh North-Easterly winds approx 10-15 mph.",
        "Comment": "Becoming milder late Saturday with freezing levels above the summits with strong South or South-Easterly winds.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, the freezing level will be around 800 metres, it will slowly rise to be above the summits by the end of the day. Some very light, intermittent snow showers can be expected overnight and again late afternoon falling mostly above 1000 metres. Moderate Northerly winds will back and ease before strengthening during the day to become fresh to strong South-Easterly.",
        "SnowStability": "New snow amounts are not expected to be deep or extensive. The snowpack will remain generally well bonded and stable in most locations. Greatest snow accumulations will exist on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 800 metres. Some areas at higher elevations are expected to be hard and icy, possibly covered by a thin layer of new snow.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight, the freezing level fell to around 800 metres and some precipitation gave a light cover of new snow mainly above 850 metres. A damp start early this morning then it was predominately dry with moderate to fresh North-Easterly winds, brighter conditions arrived in the afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "New snow amounts above 850 metres are not significant. The snowpack remains generally well bonded and stable in most locations. Greatest snow accumulations are on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 850 metres there is also a light cover of snow on other aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "A fresh covering on most aspects today. Not particularly deep, expected to refreeze becoming icy underfoot. Our Northern boundary holding more snow at higher elevations, worth checking with SAIS Northern Cairngorms if planning to head into main hills.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A bright and dry day is expected. Overnight freezing level will be down to 500 metres, lifting to around 800 metres during the day. Winds will be very light around dawn but will become strong from the South-South-East later.",
        "SnowStability": "The majority of the snowpack will be firm and generally well bonded. Greatest amounts will be found around coire rims and gully tops, mostly on West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "There is a uniform covering of soft, wet snow above 600 metres. Drifting of new snow was limited with new accumulations only achieving depth on Southerly aspects above 900 metres, mainly in wind sheltered locations. Older snow had not yet refrozen.

        "SnowStability": "Initially unstable windslab will continue to develop on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000m.  As the day progresses lying snow will be redistributed and new windslab will develop on North-West to North-East aspects mainly above 1000m; this will become increasingly unstable during the afternoon with avalanches likely. Localised windslab also on steep banks below 1000m. Cross loading onto West and East aspects.  Fragile cornices will develop. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

Localised accumulations of moderate and poorly bonded windslab have developed on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres.  Fragile cornices have also developed on these aspects.  Cross loading has affected  Northerly aspects.  The greatest instability is in wind sheltered steep locations such as gully exits, crag aprons and coire rims.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Showers will peter out early evening to give a largely dry day, although a little summit snow is possible late afternoon on the coastal hills. Fresh Northerly winds will become light overnight, freshening again and veering South-East through the day. Colder overnight, with the freezing level rising from around 600 metres to near summit levels by day.",
        "SnowStability": "The recent shallow covering of snow above 650 metres, mostly lying on bare ground, will thaw at lower levels through the day. Isolated deeper deposits of snow are likely in sheltered South to South-West aspects above 800 metres, but will not be significant. The old snow will remain firm and well bonded, largely found on high North to East aspects on the more inland mountains. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Trace snowfall overnight is expected to precede a generally dry day. Overnight winds will be strong Northerlies, veering to Easterly and decreasing to become light in strength. During the day winds will increase to become very strong South-Easterlies. The freezing level will be around 700 metres rising later, however the snow temperatures will remain sub zero due a stable airmass.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of moderately bonded windslab will persist on South to West aspects above 950 metres. Further accumulations will develop on North-West and North aspects above 950 metres, as snow is redistributed. Steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and scarp slopes will be affected, although most accumulations are expected to be shallow and avoidable. Slopes exposed to the wind will become firm. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow fall and light snow showers during the day, confined to above 800 metres at midday. Winds were moderate and from the East-South-East. The freezing level was around 950 metres at midday.",

Steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and scarp slopes are particularly affected. Outwith these locations, a firm crust is evident where the moist snowpack is exposed to the wind. Elsewhere a cosmetic dusting of wet snow is present above 800 metres. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowStability": "Localised areas of unstable windslab will persist mainly on South-West to North-West aspects above 1000 metres. North aspects will also be affected in the afternoon due to snow redistribution as the wind increases.
