Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Especially slopes adjacent to ridgelines are unfavourable. Avalanches can in very isolated cases be triggered in the old snowpack and reach quite a large size. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses. <br/> From origins in starting zones where no previous releases have taken place more gliding avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. This applies in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2600 m. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks.",
