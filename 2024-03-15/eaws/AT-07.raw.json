Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation individual loose snow avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. This applies in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes."

      "comment" : "Up to 10 cm of snow will fall above approximately 2000 m. The wind will be moderate to strong. Fresh wind slabs are bonding well with the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> The spring-like weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to moistening of the snowpack. The old snowpack will be well bonded over a wide area. <br/> Below the tree line only a little snow is now lying."
