On south-facing and also some east- and west-facing slopes, a strong or brittle crust is present at intermediate altitudes. The increasing southerly wind is transporting loose snow. Wind slabs are growing and their number is increasing. The fresh wind slabs are lying locally on surface hoar and are often prone to triggering.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places. However, around the crusts in the upper third of the old snowpack, layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure are deposited, in which, especially in the inneralpine regions of Grisons above around 2400 m, avalanches have still been released in recent days.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes.

On south-facing and also some east- and west-facing slopes, a strong or brittle crust is present at intermediate altitudes. The increasing southerly wind is transporting loose snow. Wind slabs are growing and their number is increasing. The fresh wind slabs are lying locally on surface hoar and are often prone to triggering.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places. However, around the crusts in the upper third of the old snowpack, layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure are deposited, in which, especially in the inneralpine regions of Grisons above around 2400 m, avalanches have still been released in recent days.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes. These may be large.</p>"
