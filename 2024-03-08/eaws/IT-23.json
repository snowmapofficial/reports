In addition in the afternoon an increasing number of medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are possible. They can occur in particular in starting zones where previous releases have taken place. <br/> Fresh wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence. As the snowfall becomes more intense the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase. They can be released by a single winter sport participant above approximately 2000 m. These places are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger. <br/>",
