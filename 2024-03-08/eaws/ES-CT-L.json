        "comment": "The fresh snow and in particular the many sometimes large wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects and in all altitude zones. The avalanche prone locations are quite prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars and near the border with Benasque the avalanche prone locations are widespread. The avalanche danger in these regions is within the upper range of danger level 3 (considerable). <br/> The conditions are dangerous for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities.",
        "highlights": "Fresh snow and large quantities of wind-drifted snow represent the main danger."
