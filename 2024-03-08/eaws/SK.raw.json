      "comment" : "There is a moderate avalanche danger in the High and Western Tatras above 1200 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wet snow. Dangerous are especially sunny unlit S, SW and W orientations. Avalanche release is possible on steep slopes with little additional load. Small and medium avalanches are a threat, especially in conjunction with terrain traps. The second avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. At altitudes above 1800 m above sea level, there is very locally a large amount of new snow that is deposited on the critical crustal layer. Especially dangerous are narrow couloirs and places under rock walls.",

On average, up to 20 cm of new snow has fallen in the last snowfall period, but locally there may be much more. There is also a critical layer of crusts in the snow profile. At mid-altitudes, the water-soaked snow cover from the previous days is freezing due to the cooling and is stabilising significantly. On sunlit slopes, new snow in particular is very poorly bonded to the hard ground."

On the sunlit orientations, especially in the south, southwest and west, it is soaked by the sunlight and gets wet to the hard ground. On the other hand, on shaded orientations, the snow surface is very hard and load-bearing after night frosts. Depending on the orientation, a continuous snow cover can be found from 1200 m above sea level."
