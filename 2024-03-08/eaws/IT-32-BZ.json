Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, caution is to be exercised in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation on the Main Alpine Ridge. Places where surface hoar has been covered with snow are especially unfavourable. Avalanches can reach large size in isolated cases. Careful route selection is recommended. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong southwesterly wind, sometimes avalanche prone wind slabs will form. Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep shady slopes, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2200 m. The prevalence of such avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists, in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2600 m. These can in isolated cases reach medium size. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
