      "comment" : "The fresh snow and in particular the many sometimes large wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects and in all altitude zones. The avalanche prone locations are quite prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. At the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars and near the border with Benasque the avalanche prone locations are widespread. The avalanche danger in these regions is within the upper range of danger level 3 (considerable). <br/> The conditions are dangerous for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities."

The wind will be moderate to strong over a wide area. The southerly wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> The fresh wind slabs are lying on weak layers on shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 90 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."
