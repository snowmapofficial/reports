      "comment" : "As the moisture increases at any time small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are to be expected. These can sometimes be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects in all altitude zones. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The surface of the snow cover is brown due to the effect of the Sahara dust. The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will soften quickly. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes only a little snow is lying."
