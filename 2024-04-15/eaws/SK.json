        "comment": "There is a moderate avalanche danger in the Tatras above 1800 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially the leeward sides of ridges, narrow chutes and places under rock walls are dangerous. Particularly in these places there may be wind-blown slabs of varying hardness. They can be loosened, especially on steep slopes with high additional loads. Small to medium avalanches are a risk in combination with terrain traps. Spontaneous foundation avalanches are also expected due to rain. All orientations are hazardous.",

In the morning, the snowfall limit will be at 1900 m above sea level, gradually decreasing to about 1100 m.  Between 10 and 15 new snow is expected at the highest altitudes, but this will be very unevenly distributed due to strong NW winds. Ridges and mountain tops are mostly melted into rocks or grassy base. There is still sufficient snow cover in the troughs and on the leeward sides of the ridges. Snow cover will stabilize as it cools, but watch for locally winding slabs.  A continuous layer of snow can be found from about 1600m above sea level and mainly on northeast to east orientations."
