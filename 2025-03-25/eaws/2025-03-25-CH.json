On south-facing slopes, the connection between the fresh and drifted snow and the old snowpack is more favourable.</p><p>In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, the old snowpack is faceted and loose. In those regions of Ticino exposed to heavier precipitation, the weakly bonded old snowpack is now deeply covered in many places. Particularly in the Monte Rosa region, on the eastern part of the main Alpine ridge, in the Upper Engadine and in Val M\u00fcstair, avalanches have continued to be triggered in the old snowpack in recent days.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into high Alpine regions, as well as on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2000 to 2200 m. On northern slopes moistening is only superficial. In recent days, a number of wet and gliding avalanches, some of the latter large, have been triggered. A combination of sometimes declining outgoing longwave radiation, daytime irradiation and higher temperatures means that gliding and wet avalanches are still possible.</p>"
