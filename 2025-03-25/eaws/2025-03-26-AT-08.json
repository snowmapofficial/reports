One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. Near-surface weak layers, esp in little-tracked terrain on shady steep slopes, are often still prone to triggering. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible.",
