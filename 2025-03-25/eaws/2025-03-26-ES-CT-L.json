        "comment": "As the penetration by moisture increases more moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected at any time, even large ones. These can be released easily or triggered naturally. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> The fresh and older wind slabs are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in the high Alpine regions. These can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. The wind slabs will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. Dry snow slides are possible in particular at high altitude. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
