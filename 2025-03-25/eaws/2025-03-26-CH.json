With increasing northerly winds, snowdrift accumulations that are prone to triggering are developing locally in the south.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into high Alpine regions, as well as on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2000 to 2200 m. On northern slopes moistening is only superficial. In the last few days, several wet and gliding avalanches, some of the latter large, have been triggered. A combination of sometimes declining outgoing longwave radiation, and daytime irradiation with higher temperatures means that gliding and wet avalanches are still possible.</p>"
