Significant snowfalls were often blown by strong winds up to the forest zone. However, on the leeward sides of the mountains (especially SE and E), winds have locally created snow pillows and slabs, the stability of which may be low, especially on steep to very steep slopes. Avalanches can be released locally, especially by large additional loads. On the S side of the mountains at the highest altitudes, especially in steep and narrow couloirs, there is still a persistently weak layer of square-grained snow in the snow profile, which has not stabilised due to severe frosts. Small spontaneous avalanches may occur sporadically during the day, mainly from new snow, which will become heavier as the forecast warming warms up.",
