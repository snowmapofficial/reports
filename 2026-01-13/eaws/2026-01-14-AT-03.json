        "comment": "The avalanche danger is categorised as low (level 1). The main problem is small, wet slides, which can be triggered in a few places by additional load. Spontaneous, small loose snow slides are also possible in isolated cases, especially from steep slopes in southern and eastern aspects. With the sunshine and rising temperatures, the danger of spontaneous loose snow slides increases slightly during the daytime changes. In shady gullies and bowls above the tree line, there are still prone to triggering snowdrift accumulations. These can be triggered by a single person as a small slab avalanche.",
