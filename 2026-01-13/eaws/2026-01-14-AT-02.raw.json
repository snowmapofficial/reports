The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on southwest to north to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and on steep south facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. In particular in shady places that are protected from the wind avalanches can release the weakly bonded old snow as well and reach quite a large size. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in gullies and bowls. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last few days. The strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. <br/> <br/> In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded still only poorly. The wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack. The old snowpack is faceted. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations.
