Avalanches can reach medium size. Avalanche prone locations can be found in all areas adjacent to the ridgeline or summit, behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. They increase in size and frequency with altitude. The wind slab is easily recognisable and should be avoided at all costs; the transition from a little to a lot of snow is particularly critical. Cracks in the snow cover, snowpack also indicate danger. In addition to the risk of burial, the danger of being swept away and falling must be taken into account.
