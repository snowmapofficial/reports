Slab avalanches can be triggered on steep slopes with aspects from north-west to east to south as well as in gullies and bowls with little additional load. The number of avalanche prone locations increases with altitude and avalanches can become large in places at higher altitudes in areas with more snow.\n\nWet snow is also problematic. Loose snow, gliding snow and slab avalanches can detach themselves in all aspects, especially at medium altitudes (1000 m - 2000 m). At high altitudes, southern exposures are particularly affected when the sun comes out. Wet avalanches can reach medium size."

The warm temperatures and solar radiation lead to further soaking of the snow cover, even at high altitudes, causing the snow to lose its bond. Up to high altitudes, the snow cover, snowpack is wet to the ground or at least moist near the surface. A melt-freeze crust forms on the surface overnight, which thaws again during the daytime changes."
