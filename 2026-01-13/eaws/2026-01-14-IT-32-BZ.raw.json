The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on west to north to southeast facing aspects above the tree line. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In isolated cases avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack.
