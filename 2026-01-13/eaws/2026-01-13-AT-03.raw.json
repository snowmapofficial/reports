However, the snowfall level will rise steadily from the west (to around 1800 metres by the evening) and the precipitation will increasingly turn into freezing rain at low altitudes. The mountain peaks will be covered in thick clouds all day, with only a few clearings. It will snow or rain a little in the morning hours, but the precipitation will soon subside and it will be largely dry throughout the day. Temperatures at 2000 metres will be between -4 and 0 degrees, at 1500 metres between -2 and +3 degrees. The westerly wind will be strong to gale-force and will ease slightly from midday."
