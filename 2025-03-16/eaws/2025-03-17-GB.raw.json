        "Summary": "NC for 17.3: Snowpack consolidating. Good stability. Light drifting, isolated windslab on NW to NE aspects above 1000m. Low Hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable rain crust at higher levels.  Cloudy above 900m  with clear bright spells during the afternoon. Winds approx 10 to 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "Settled wintry conditions during the first part of this week. Becoming much milder by Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions are expected throughout the forecast period. Moderate East winds will become South-South-Easterly from the middle of the night onwards.  The 800 metre freezing level will steadily rise to 1000 metres by the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to consolidate and stabilise in most locations.  There will be the potential for some redistribution of lying snow with windslab developing on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.  These will be shallow and limited in extent and mostly accumulate around the tops of gullies corrie rims and convex terrain.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Spells of drizzle turned to very light snowfall above 1000 metres.  Northerly winds were light to moderate at plateau levels. The freezing level at midday was around 1100 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Accumulations of windslab remain on Easterly to Southerly aspects above 1000 metres.  These are beginning to consolidate; however instabilities were observed within deeper deposits.  Areas especially affected are steep locations such as the tops of gullies, coire rims and convex terrain. Elsewhere the snowpack is generally well bonded, and steadily depleting below 800 metres. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snow cover, better above 1000m.  Northerly winds approx 15-25 mph  - cold! Poor visibility, variable cloud base often 800m.",
        "Comment": "High pressure maintaining settled conditions for the start of the week. Milder weather arriving on Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "No precipitation forecast. Fresh North-Easterly winds overnight, veering South-South-Easterly and easing to moderate during the day. 650 metre freezing level overnight, gradually rising to 1200 metres by the end of the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The remaining snow will firm up overnight before gradually softening again during the day. There will be a steady reduction in the superficial snow cover at lower elevations. Firmer, old snow will be present in steeper, wind sheltered locations on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Low cloud with intermittent light sleet and wet snow above 900 metres. Fresh Northerly winds. Freezing level rising to 1000 metres by late morning.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Recent windslab accumulations in steeper, wind sheltered locations on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres have become generally well bonded and stable. Visible snow reduction below 800 metres and on South facing slopes. Firm old snow patches remain on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "A trace of newer snow still present but mostly on bare ground above 900 metres and dissipating. Patches of firm snow also exist mainly above 850 metres. Good visibility. Light, North-Easterly winds approx 5mph to 15mph.",
        "Comment": "High pressure will maintain dry, settled weather. Freezing level generally around 1000 metres, this will rise above the summits on Thursday as milder air affects the area.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mainly dry weather. The overnight freezing level will be around 800 metres rising during the day, ending at 1100 metres. The East-North-Easterly winds will veer to become South-Easterly, remaining generally light.",
        "SnowStability": "The older snow patches will still exist on North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres, particularly in sheltered hollows, gullies and steep coire rims. These deposits will refreeze overnight becoming firm and icy then slowly soften during the day, stability will remain good in all locations. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It was the mildest day of the week, along with more cloud cover. Some isolated precipitation fell mostly as drizzle or light rain. This gave some brief sleet over the highest summits. Winds were generally light from the North-Easterly direction. The freezing level rose to around 1000 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Above 900 metres, some of the recent past snow fall still lingers; this continues to thaw and diminish. The firmer, older snow patches in sheltered hollows, gullies and steep coire rims are also starting to thaw and soften, but remain generally stable. Greatest deposits remain on North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
