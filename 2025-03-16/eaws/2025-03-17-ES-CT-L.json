        "comment": "The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on west to north to southeast facing aspects and above the tree line. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in many cases easily released. At the southern border of Aran the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation moist avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can in some cases be released by people and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. These avalanche prone locations are covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and weakly bonded old snow are to be assessed with care and prudence."
