Danger spots are located in the expositions west via north to southeast. Small to medium slab avalanches can be triggered by an individuals in steep slopes. Caution behind ridgelines. Small spontaneous loose-snow avalanches coming from extremely steep, rocky terrain are possible. Gliding-snow avalanches coming from steep grassy terrain cannot be ruled out."

In medium altitudes the new snow landed on top of bare areas and has no base."
