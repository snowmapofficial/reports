        "comment": "Avalanches can be triggered in the old snow even by one sole skier. In addition, avalanches can be triggered even by minimum additional loading in the near-surface layers of the snowpack, esp above 2000m. Avalanches can on shady slopes sweep along the moist layers of the old snowpack and grow to large size. Caution urged at the foot of rock walls and behind protruberances in the terrain, and in gullies and bowls. Due to moistening, increasingly frequent moist loose-snow avalanches can be expected, also medium-sized ones, esp. after a night of cloudy skies on extremely steep slopes. Caution also urged towards moist slides and avalanches, also medium sized releases on extremely steep slopes after a night of cloudy skies. The runout zones should be circumvented. On very steep grass-covered slopes glide-snow avalanches are possible, also medium sized releases.",

More deeply embedded inside the snowpack on shady slopes are faceted, expansively metamorphosed weak layers, esp. above 1900m."
