However, the upper layers of the new snow and wind slabs are sometimes prone to triggering. In the other regions, new snow and wind slabs are particularly prone to triggering on shady slopes where they lie on an unfavourable old snow surface consisting of soft, faceted layers. These layers of new snow and wind slabs are thickest along the Main Alpine Ridge.</p><p>In Valais, Ticino and Grisons, deeper layers of the snowpack are loose and faceted. Avalanches can sometimes be triggered into these deep layers of the snowpack, especially on shady slopes.</p><p>As a consequence of solar radiation, loose snow avalanches and gliding avalanches are to be expected in regions with a lot of new snow, especially on sunny slopes. These may occasionally become large in the south.
