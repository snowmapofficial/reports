During the last period of heavy precipitation locally up to 30cm of new snow fell. It has been transported by the wind to the leeward slopes, especially to the northern orientations. Here there may be snow slabs and pillows which may not be well bonded to the ground. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads in steep and very steep terrain.",
