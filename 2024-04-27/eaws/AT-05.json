        "comment": "Saturday night skies will have scattered clouds in the north, heavier clouds will move over the southern regions, thus reducing the nocturnal outgoing longwave radiation somewhat. Winds from the south will be brisk.\r\nOn Sunday, pleasant conditions, occasionally heavier clouds but visibility will remain good. Frequent sunshine, somewhat hampered by clouds and Sahara dust. Foehn wind along the Tauern will be brisk (gusts up to 70 km/hr) but slacken off in evening. At 2000 m: 1-7 degrees; at 3000 m: -2 to +2 degrees. Skies on Sunday night will be clear but for a few high-altitude clouds."
