In some places, old snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as a slab avalanche by even a small additional load in very steep terrain in the north-west to north to south-east aspects. The number and size of avalanche prone locations increase with altitude. Avalanches can reach medium size if deeper, weak layers are also triggered."
