Weakly bonded old snow represents the main danger.","comment":"The fresh snow as well as the widespread wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line, in isolated cases also in areas close to the tree line, and on steep sunny slopes at elevated altitudes. Avalanches can be released easily and reach medium size. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Caution is to be exercised in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and fresh avalanches serve as an alarm indicating the danger. <br/> <br/> Field observations and fresh avalanches confirm a treacherous avalanche situation. Caution and restraint are recommended."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"The new snow and wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack. Distinct weak layers exist in the old snowpack. This applies especially on west, north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes the snowpack will freeze but not form a strong crust, in particular below approximately 2400 m."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Avalanches can as before be released, even by a single winter sport participant.
