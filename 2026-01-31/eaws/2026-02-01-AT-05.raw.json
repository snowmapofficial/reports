In some places, slab avalanches can be triggered by individuals and can be of medium size. Transitions from little to more snow should be consistently avoided. Caution should also be exercised at the entrances to steep gullies and behind terrain edges, where prone to triggering snow packs are located. These are sometimes covered in snow and therefore difficult to recognise. Avalanches that are triggered near the surface in fresh wind slabs can tear through to deeper weak layers. Whumpfing collapsing sounds when stepping on the snowpack can indicate danger. Remote triggering is possible."

Below this, the old snowpack consists of deep rime and angular forms interspersed with crusts. Fractures in the persistent weak layer usually occur around the uppermost crust, but can also entrain deeper layers. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
