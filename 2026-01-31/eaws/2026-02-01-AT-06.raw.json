Here, avalanches can be triggered by even small additional loads and can reach medium size when breaking through the weak old snowpack. In some cases, there is a thin, bound layer from the last snowfall. The danger areas are mainly located in the transition from little to more snow as well as behind terrain edges and in the entrance area of gullies and bowls. Some of the danger spots are difficult to recognise."

In the northern and eastern exposures, the snowpack is still weakened by layers with faceted crystals and floating snow (persistent weak layer problem!)."
