One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches. Also remote triggerings are possible. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls as well as behind sharp drops in the terrain. Triggered avalanches can sweep away deeper layers of the old snowpack and grow to medium size. Such avalanche prone locations occur particularly on steep shady slopes and are not visible. Activities in backcountry require cautious evaluation of the terrain and avalanche dangers, as well as restraint. On sunny slopes, generally small-sized loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day.",

They are blanketed, making them impossible to see. One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger generally small-sized avalanches. If these sweep away deeper layers inside the snowpack, the avalanches can grow to medium size in isolated cases. Danger zones for avalanches triggering in the old snow occur especially in transitions from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution. On sunny slopes, mostly small-sized loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day.",
