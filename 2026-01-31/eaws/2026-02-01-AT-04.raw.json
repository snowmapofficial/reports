      "comment" : "On Sunday, even above the high fog patches near the valley, extensive and sometimes quite dense medium-high cloud fields will pass through. The sun will have a hard time with partly limited visibility and will only break through the clouds occasionally and often in a very subdued manner. The wind will be weak at all altitudes. Temperatures at 1500 m around -4 degrees, at 2000 m -7 degrees.\nMonday will be increasingly sunny after a few patches of fog and high fog. The wind will remain mainly weak. Temperatures will rise from -4 to 0 degrees in 1500 m and from -6 to -2 degrees in 2000 m during the daytime changes."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is low. However, there are still localised avalanche prone locations in the shady and north-facing higher elevations due to the old snow problem. In steep terrain, slab avalanches can be triggered in places by winter sports enthusiasts. Avalanche prone locations are mainly adjacent to ridgelines and behind terrain edges. These are somewhat covered and therefore difficult to recognise."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The old snowpack, which is hard on the surface, is thinly covered and contains crystals without bonds that have been transformed internally. This means that the snow base, fundament is high and weakened, especially on the north and east sides. Only in very exposed areas could there be some older wind slab on a small scale. In general, there is only little snow, which is very unevenly distributed."
