Avalanches can be released easily and reach medium size. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Caution is to be exercised in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and natural avalanches serve as an alarm indicating the danger. <br/> <br/> Field observations and avalanches triggered by explosives confirm the unfavourable bonding of the snowpack. Caution and restraint are recommended."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"The new snow and wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack. Distinct weak layers exist in the old snowpack.
