        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, the light East-South-Easterly winds will veer and strengthen becoming fresh South-South-Westerly in direction. The freezing level will lower to around 800 metres. Early in the morning showers will fall as snow mainly above 650 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "New shallow accumulations of unstable windslab will form in wind sheltered areas mostly on North-West to North-East aspects above 850 metres. Instabilities will also remain in older deposits of poorly bonded windslab that exist on West and Easterly aspects above 850 metres.
