In the eastern half of Styria brisk southwesterly winds are called which weakens during the afternoon. Temperatures are rising quickly during the course of the day and will be around 2 to 4 degrees in 2.000 m at noon."

These avalanches are mostly small  sized. Occasionaly fresh snowdrift deposits in high altitudes on shady slopes and adjaecent to ridgelines could be triggered as small slab avalanches."

Due to radiation the snow will get firn-like already in the morning and gets increasingly moist and instable. on shady slopes in hight altitudes loose snow is found in some places, and in rare cases fresh snowdrift deposits which are prone to triggering have formed due to southern winds. The snow surface is often icy or hoar-like. The snow base is predominantly stable. Especially on sunny slopes only little amounts of snow is found even in high altitudes."
