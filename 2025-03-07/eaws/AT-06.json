Due to radiation the snow will get firn-like already in the morning and gets increasingly moist and instable. on shady slopes in hight altitudes loose snow is found in some places, and in rare cases fresh snowdrift deposits which are prone to triggering have formed due to southern winds. The snow surface is often icy or hoar-like. The snow base is predominantly stable. Especially on sunny slopes only little amounts of snow is found even in high altitudes."
