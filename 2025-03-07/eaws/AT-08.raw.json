      "comment" : "Predominantly favorable conditions prevail in the morning hours, with low avalanche danger. Due to daytime warming and solar radiation, moist slides and small wet-snow avalanches are possible esp. on steep sunny slopes, including more frequent medium-sized releases. Isolated danger zones occur at high altitudes esp. on shady ridgeline steep slopes, they can trigger small slab avalanches in steep shady terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "At high altitudes on shady slopes, isolated near-surface weak layers are evident, prone to triggering. On higher-altitude shady slopes the uppermost layers of often still powdery. At night on sunny slopes and at lower altitudes, a melt-freeze crust forms, which then softens up during the daytime, often breakable crusts. The below-average old snowpack is well consolidated all in all. With rising temperatures and solar radiation, the snowpack is moistening down to intermediate altitudes, and as it becomes wetter, it becomes weaker."
