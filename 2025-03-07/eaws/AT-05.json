Slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier and in unfavorable circumstances reach medium size where snow is sufficient or if fractures down to more deeply embedded layers occur. Danger zones occur esp. on NW/N/E facing slopes, esp. near ridgelines on occasion distant from ridgelines. Caution urged esp. at entry points into very steel gullies and bowls. During the course of the day, naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches (mostly Danger Level 1) can be expected in extremely steep south-facing terrain below 2800m. On steep grass-covered slopes, isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible in isolated cases.",
