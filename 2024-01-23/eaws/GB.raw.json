        "Summary": "GC for 24/01.  Snowpack instabilities on NE to SE aspects above 850 metres. Moderate Hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack, generally good above 800 metres.  A day of flat light and poor definition.  Winds approx 10mph or less in the sheltered Coire, but strong on the tops. Heavy rain in the afternoon.",
        "Comment": "Still breezy, but it is looking like a slightly better weather day on Wednesday, before another thaw and wet period, which is forecast during daylight hours, Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Showers of sleet and rain will fade out this evening. During the day there will be showers of snow above 850 metres. Winds will be mainly Westerly throughout the period, storm force overnight and then slowly moderating through the day to strong. Freezing levels will fall to around 850 metres by dawn, and remain there through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh windslab will build through the day, on North-East to South-East aspects above 850 metres. Wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims, gully tops and steep scarp slopes will be most affected. The existing snowpack, will begin to slowly consolidate in the cooler temperatures, but some wet instabilities may persist.  Fresh unstable cornices will build above these aspects.  Other aspects will be generally stable and will slowly become firm.\r\nThe avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Showers, of snow above 600 metres, turned to heavy rain at all levels by midday. Freezing levels were initially 700 metres, but soon rose to well above the summits. Very strong Southerly winds veered to become South-Westerly and increased to storm force during the afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "In steep, wind sheltered, North to East aspects above 800 metres, there are fresh accumulations of soft windslab. There is some weakness within this windslab, mainly due to graupel. In the afternoon, heavy rain and warm temperatures created further instability within this windslab. South to West slopes are generally stable and softening. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing wet snowpack, good above 800 metres. Cloud base was around 700 metres most of the day. Winds approx 10 - 20 mph initially, severe gales later.",
        "Comment": "After a stormy night, it will brighten up during the day as a ridge of high pressure crosses the area, with light showers possible and becoming a bit colder. Looking like it will remain unsettled and windy into the weekend.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Storm force South-Westerlies will veer West overnight and gradually ease through the day, becoming fresh to strong. Overnight rain at all levels will ease by daybreak, turning to light and scattered showers through the day, wintry above 850 metres as the freezing level lowers to around 900 metres by late morning.",
        "SnowStability": "The wet snowpack will remain stable throughout and will firm up around the higher summits as the freezing level lowers. During the day, insignificant amounts of new snow will likely accumulate in wind sheltered locations, largely above 850 metres and mainly on North to East aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Heavy rain, at all levels by the afternoon, was preceded by summit snow during the morning. Southerly gales. Freezing level initially around 750 metres, dramatically rose above the summits by late morning.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The wet snowpack is thawing at all levels and has generally good stability throughout. Most snow remains above 800 metres, mainly on North-East to South-East aspects, where it is firm around the summits, Patchy snowpack at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Localised areas of fresh unstable windslab will develop through the period with greatest accumulations on North through East to South-East aspects above 1000m. Corrie rims, gullies and ridge flanks will be most affected. Fragile cornices will start to develop above these aspects. The older snowpack will consolidate as the temperature drops and will be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "SnowStability": "A period of poor stability overnight on steep North through East to South-East aspects above 900m. Cornice collapse also possible at this time. Consolidating trend expected in older moist snow from dawn onwards. During the day localised accumulations of new moderately bonded windslab will form on steep North-East to South-East aspects above 950m.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow showers then dry for a time followed by snow turning to persistent rain. Very strong West winds became South-Westerly, later South-Easterly.  Cold overnight but suddenly mild from midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "At the time of reporting, marginally stabilized windslab was present on steep North through East to South-East aspects above 950m.  Stability expected to decline further in these locations as mild, wet conditions become established. Moist or wet better bonded snow is present on less steep ground at lower altitudes. Weakening cornices are present over selected very steep lee slopes and gullies.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",
