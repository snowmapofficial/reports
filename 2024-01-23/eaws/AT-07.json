Up to high altitudes rain will fall. <br/> The storm force wind will transport the fresh and old snow. The fresh wind slabs are in some cases prone to triggering. Towards its base, the snowpack is largely stable. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. The weather conditions will give rise to significant moistening of the snowpack especially at low and intermediate altitudes."
