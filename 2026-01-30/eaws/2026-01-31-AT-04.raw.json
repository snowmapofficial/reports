      "comment" : "On Saturday, thick patches of high fog may significantly reduce visibility on the edge of the Alps. At higher altitudes in the mountains, however, the sun will often shine alongside a few high clouds. The wind will be mostly light at all altitudes. Temperatures at 1500 m around -1 degrees, at 2000 m -4 degrees.\nOn Sunday there will again be persistent fog and high fog patches. In the mountains, the sun will shine at times above an altitude of 1000 metres, but clouds will also be present. A light easterly wind will blow. At 1500 m around -2 degrees, at 2000 m -5 degrees."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is low. There are still localised avalanche prone locations in the shady and north-facing higher elevations due to the old snow problem. In steep terrain, slab avalanches can be triggered in places by winter sports enthusiasts. Avalanche prone locations are mainly adjacent to ridgelines and behind terrain edges. These are somewhat covered and therefore difficult to recognise."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The old snowpack, which is hard on the surface, is thinly covered and contains crystals without bonds that have been transformed internally. This means that the snow base, fundament is high and weakened, especially on the north and east sides. Only in very exposed areas could there be some small-scale wind slab. In general, there is only a little snow, which is very unevenly distributed."
