      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is assessed as moderate above 1800 metres and low below that. The snow layering is still very weak, especially in the northern and eastern sectors. Here, avalanches can be triggered by even small additional loads and can reach medium size when breaking through the weak old snowpack. Above this, there are sometimes thin pillows of wind drifted snow from the last snowfall. The danger areas are mainly located in the transition from a little to a lot of snow as well as behind terrain edges and in the entrance area of gullies and bowls. The danger spots are often difficult to recognise."
