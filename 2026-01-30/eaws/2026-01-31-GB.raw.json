        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow drifts developing in lee areas above 500m, icy and scoured on wind exposed slopes.  Poor visibility throughout the day above 500 metres mainly due to drifting snow. Winds 70 gusting over 80mph, serious conditions.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers throughout the forecast period.  Gale force South-East winds will gradually ease to strong through the day.  The freezing level will be around 700 to 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will continue to develop with avalanches likely on West through North to North-East aspects mainly above 900 metres.  The greatest instability will be in steep locations such as coire headwalls, gullies, crag aprons and convex shaped terrain.  Unstable cornices will overhang these aspects.  Between 500 and 900 metres, more localised instabilities will be present on steep banks and burn lines.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

The greatest instability is above 900 metres in steep locations such as around corrie head walls, gullies and crag aprons and steep rollovers. Large cornices overhang these aspects.  Between 500 and 900 metres, moderately bonded windslab has developed on steep banks and burn lines.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

Fresh deposits of windslab will form through the day in steep wind sheltered locations such as sheltered gullies and steep slopes with a mainly South-West through West to Northerly aspect above 850 metres. Deposits are not expected to be extensive, corrie rims, ridge flanks and gully tops will be most affected. Other aspects may be affected through cross loading.

Drifting will continue for a time overnight and during the day. New deposits of weak windslab will be in place on steep South-West through West to North aspects above 900m.

Some minor cornice development noted high above steeper lee slopes.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
