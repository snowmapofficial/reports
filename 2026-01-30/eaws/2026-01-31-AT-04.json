        "comment": "The avalanche risk is low. There are still localised avalanche prone locations in the shady and north-facing higher elevations due to the old snow problem. In steep terrain, slab avalanches can be triggered in places by winter sports enthusiasts. Avalanche prone locations are mainly adjacent to ridgelines and behind terrain edges. These are somewhat covered and therefore difficult to recognise.",

This means that the snow base, fundament is high and weakened, especially on the north and east sides. Only in very exposed areas could there be some small-scale wind slab. In general, there is only a little snow, which is very unevenly distributed."

Temperatures at 1500 m around -1 degrees, at 2000 m -4 degrees.\nOn Sunday there will again be persistent fog and high fog patches. In the mountains, the sun will shine at times above an altitude of 1000 metres, but clouds will also be present. A light easterly wind will blow. At 1500 m around -2 degrees, at 2000 m -5 degrees."
