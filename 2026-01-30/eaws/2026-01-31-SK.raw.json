      "comment" : "Moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) is declared in the high altitudes of the High and Low Tatras. Due to the recent snowfall combined with strong south winds, snow slabs have formed in places, especially in the northern orientations. Avalanche release is possible on very steep slopes, especially with high additional loads. Caution, on some slopes, especially in the north, a weak layer of dangerous square-grained snow can be found deeper in the profile. At altitudes below 1600 m, the snow was soaked and therefore hardened and stabilised due to the cooling.",
