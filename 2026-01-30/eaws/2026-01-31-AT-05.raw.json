The number and size of avalanche prone locations generally increase rapidly above the tree line. Transitions from little to more snow should be consistently avoided. Caution should also be exercised at the entrances to steep gullies and bowls as well as behind the edges of the terrain, where prone-to-triggering snow packs are located. These are sometimes covered in snow and therefore difficult to recognise. Avalanches that are triggered close to the surface can tear through to deeper weak layers. Whumpfing collapsing sounds when stepping on the snowpack can indicate danger."

The older snowdrift accumulations and the old snow surface are in places transformed and soft, in places hard as a board.
