        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day especially above the tree line. The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on steep shady slopes. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase from midday. In isolated cases avalanches are large. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach dangerously large size. <br/> <br/> <br/> The conditions are sometimes critical for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities.",
