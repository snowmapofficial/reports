The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on steep shady slopes. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase from midday. In isolated cases avalanches are large. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach dangerously large size. <br/> <br/> <br/> The conditions are sometimes critical for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Sunday above approximately 1500 m. The northwesterly wind will transport the new snow significantly. Over a wide area new snow and wind slabs are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Large-grained weak layers exist in the bottom section of the old snowpack in particular on west, north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 130 to 170 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Sunday: Significant increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the snowfall.
