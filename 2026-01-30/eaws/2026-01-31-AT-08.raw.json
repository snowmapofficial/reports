One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and behind drops in the terrain. Releases can sweep away deeper layers of the snowpack and grow to medium size. Such danger zones are not visitlbe, particularly on steep shady slopes. Activities in backcountry demand careful evaluation of terrain and dangers, as well as restraint. On sunny slopes, small loose-snow slides can trigger naturally during the course of the day."

These are often blanketed over, making them impossible to recognize. One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger small, in isolated cases medium-sized slab avalanches. Other danger zones occur on extremely steep, mostly shady slopes. In isolated cases there, small avalanches can be triggered in the old snow. Such danger zones occur particularly in transitions from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution. On sunny slopes, small loose-snow slides can trigger naturally during the course of the day."

They are often blanketed over, making them impossible to recognize. The fresh snow from Wednesday night often covered surface hoar. Particularly on steep shady slopes there are still unfavorable intermediate layers inside the old snowpack which have persisted. Small avalanche triggerings and fracture on the surface confirm the trigger-sensitivity of the snowpack."
