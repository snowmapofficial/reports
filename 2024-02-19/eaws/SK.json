        "comment": "The weather in the mountains of Slovakia is influenced by a low pressure furrow. It will bring clouds and precipitation above 1200 m above sea level from noon on Tuesday. The old snow cover has frozen due to the change in temperatures, the cloud cover during Tuesday will prevent intensive melting of the snow cover. In the morning, therefore, a low avalanche danger (1st degree) is valid in the Fatras and the eastern part of the Low Tatras. In the afternoon, due to new snow lying on top of the old frozen snow cover, there is a moderate avalanche danger from 1300 m above sea level (level 2).  In several places there are gusts in the mountains. Despite the hardening of the snow cover, base avalanches from slippery snow may occur in these places.",
        "highlights": "Snow showers are expected from midday. Large difference in hardness between the old frozen cover and the layer of new snow. Watch out for slopes with glide cracs."
