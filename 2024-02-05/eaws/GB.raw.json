        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack, best cover remains on Northerly and Easterly aspects above 900 metres.  Cloudy with heavy rain all day.  Winds approx 40 gusting 60 mph generally South-Westerly.",
        "Comment": "New snow amounts overnight are not expected to be significant. Old snow will start to refreeze becoming icy in places with serious slip potential.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Rain will die out overnight as colder conditions return, with the freezing level lowering to around 600 metres. There will be a trace of new snow initially then becoming dry. Winds will be fresh to strong Westerly becoming North-Westerly later.",
        "SnowStability": "A return to colder conditions will start to refreeze the snowpack giving good general stability. Exposed slopes may become firm and icy. Trace amounts of new snow overnight are not expected to be significant but isolated pockets of windslab may form in wind sheltered areas such as gully tops and corrie headwalls with a North to South-Easterly aspect. These areas, if they form, should be avoidable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Mild conditions with very heavy rain at all levels have affected the area. Winds have been generally strong to gale force South-Westerly. The freezing level is well above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Heavy rain overnight and today has saturated the snowpack with a reduction of cover, particularly at lower levels. Stability is generally good but isolated wet snow instabilities remain on the very steepest slopes on North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Getting colder! Freezing level around the summits overnight will lower to around 500 metres by daybreak then to 400 metres by the end of the forecast period. Precipitation falling as snow, mostly showers, sometimes heavier, throughout the forecast period, lying at glen level at around 200 metres and above. Winds will be strong to gale force West-South-Westerly to North-Westerly.",
        "SnowStability": "The old snow lying thinly above 800 metres will freeze and stabilise. New accumulations of snow will gradually build on Northerly through East to South-Easterly aspects. This will lie on slopes at all levels but will only be of significance at higher elevations above 800 metres where it gains depth. Wind sheltered coire rims and gully tops being most affected. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
