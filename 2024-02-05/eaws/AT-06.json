Above 2000 m, isolated slab avalanches can be triggered on shady slopes. As a result of higher temperatures, small wet naturally triggered avalanches are possible on steep rough and rocky slopes.",

At intermediate altitudes the snowpak is moist-to-wet, also rotten. The nights are far too mild, the snowpack below 1500 m can\u2019t freeze. On steep shady slopes at high altitudes (above 2000 m), expansive metamorphosis is weakening the snowpack base. The slopes at intermediate and lower altitudes are becoming bare of snow."
