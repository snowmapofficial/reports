      "comment" : "In the high altitudes of the High Tatras (above 1800 m above sea level) there is a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. Due to rain and warming, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes, where a larger amount of snow is concentrated, are dangerous. Here it is possible to release an avalanche, especially with a large additional load. Only small avalanches or avalanches can be expected. Avalanches are no longer expected in other mountain ranges."

      "comment" : "The snow cover is wet due to the strong warming and rain at all altitudes and often throughout the entire profile down to the base. Continuous snow cover is found from 1900 - 2000 m above sea level (depending on orientation), with the most of it in terrain depressions, in troughs and in the valleys of the Tatra valleys. In case of a fall on the snow fields there is a risk of hitting the rocks."
