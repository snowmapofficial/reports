        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and wind, sometimes deep wind slabs formed in the last few days adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as above approximately 2600 m. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases especially on very steep shady slopes. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m individual mostly small moist and wet avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a rapid increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow.",
