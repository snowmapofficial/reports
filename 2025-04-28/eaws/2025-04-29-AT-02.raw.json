Below 2800m mostly small releases are possible, esp. along the Salzburg border. Caution urged esp. on very steep slopes and at the foot of rock walls. Snowdrift accumulations are no longer very trigger-sensitive. Isolated danger zones occur on shady slopes above 2800m."

The snowpack is thoroughly wet, esp. on sday slopes below 2800m and on sunny slopes below 3200m. In all regions there is too little snow on the ground. Below 2200m there is hardly any snow. Carnic Alps: below 1800m, hardly any snow on the ground."
