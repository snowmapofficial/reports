In the afternoon, some large spring clouds will become noticeable over the mountains, but the probability of local thundery showers will remain low. An isolated warm thunderstorm is most likely to develop in the evening over the mountains of western Upper Styria. With mostly light winds from the east to northeast, temperatures of up to 9 degrees will be reached at 2000m."
