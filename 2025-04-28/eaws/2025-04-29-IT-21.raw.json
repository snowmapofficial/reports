In these regions and above approximately 2700 m the avalanche danger is considerable (level 3). In particular at intermediate and high altitudes and on steep sunny slopes medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation. Backcountry touring calls for careful route selection."
