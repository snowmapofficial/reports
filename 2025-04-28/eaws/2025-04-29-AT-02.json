        "comment": "Due to daytime warming and solar radiation, likelihood of wet-snow avalanches triggering will increase. Below 2800m mostly small releases are possible, esp. along the Salzburg border. Caution urged esp. on very steep slopes and at the foot of rock walls. Snowdrift accumulations are no longer very trigger-sensitive. Isolated danger zones occur on shady slopes above 2800m.",
