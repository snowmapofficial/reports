        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in specific places. Cloud base was at 700 metres all day.  Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Mostly dry during the day until later in the afternoon when there is the potential for some more snowfall at higher elevations.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snowfall above 800 metres overnight and again at the end of the afternoon on the highest summits only. Strong South-West backing South-South-East winds. Freezing level lowering to 800 metres by morning, then rising to 1100 metres by the end of the period.",
        "SnowStability": "Shallow accumulations of windslab may form in wind sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 800 metres. Amounts are not expected to be significant but will overlie old snow in gully lines and around corrie rims above 950 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light snow above 850 metres quickly transitioned to rain as the freezing level rose above the summits by late morning. Gale force, Southerly winds.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Thawing snowpack. Poor visibility in cloud on summits. Winds around 40 mph, progress difficult.",
        "Comment": "Low confidence in the amount of fresh snow due to unpredictable shower activity.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Very strong South-South-Westerly winds back to the South-South-East in the afternoon. Showers falling as rain at all elevations in the evening will fall as snow above 600 to 800 metres for the remainder of the period. The freezing level will drop to around 800 metres, rising slightly in the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated areas of windslab will develop through the period mainly on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres with features such as gully tops and corrie rims most affected. On other aspects and at lower elevations the snowpack will be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

However, fresh deposits of windslab will be deposited mainly on sheltered North-West through North to East aspects  above 1000 metres with the tops of slopes and gullies being most affected. Below this level, and on other aspects the snowpack will be much shallower and stable. Some fragile cornices will exist, but these will not be particularly extenisve. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",

However, these areas are not particularly extensive.  A recent avalanche released at the top of an East facing gully at an altitude of 1200 metres. Some weak cornices also exist, but again these are quite localised.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate",

        "WeatherInfluences": "A return to colder conditions overnight will bring snow showers which will affect slopes mainly above 800 metres. Winds will be strong occasionally gale generally South-Westerly overnight backing South-South-East through the day. The freezing level will fluctuate around 900 metres through the period. There is a possibility of more persistent snow later in the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Colder conditions overnight will start to re-freeze the existing snow. Snow showers and variable Southerly winds will form pockets of unstable windslab and fragile small cornices mainly above 900 metres in gully exits and around North-Westerly to Easterly corrie rims. These areas are not expected to be deep or extensive and in the main should be avoidable.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers are expected overnight and into the morning above 800 metres. Amounts are not expected to be significant, unless showers merge. Winds will be from the South-South-West backing to become South-South-East, and of gale to storm force. The freezing level will be 800 metres in the later rising to 1200 metres later.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated deposits of unstable windslab will accumulate in steep wind sheltered locations on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres. These will be mostly avoidable and confined to areas such as coire rims and gully tops, where they will overlie the older residual snowpack. Outwith these areas, the existing snowpack will be very firm, with a dusting of fresh snow present above 800 metres. Small fragile cornices will develop. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

A superficial dusting of moist snow was present above 1000 metres, mostly in very sheltered areas or overlying residual snow fields. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
