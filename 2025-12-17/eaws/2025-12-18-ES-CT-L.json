        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs are mostly shallow and prone to triggering. On wind-loaded slopes small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized dry avalanches are possible. In particular in the south and in the east and above approximately 2200 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. In the northern half of Aran these avalanche prone locations are more rare and the danger is lower. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In particular steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible in all altitude zones.",
