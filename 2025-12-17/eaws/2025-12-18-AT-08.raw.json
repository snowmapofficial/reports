      "comment" : "Avalanches can be triggered in the persistent weak layer in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes. These releases are usually small-sized. The risks of injuries from being forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. Freshly generated, small-sized snowdrift accumulations are prone to triggering and require attentiveness. Isolated, usually small-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible on steep smooth slopes which have not yet discharged."

      "comment" : "The shallow snowpack is well consolidated for the most part, and low in tensions. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers inside the snowpack occur. As a result of intermittently strong foehn winds, loose old snow was transported from place to place and generated small-sized snowdrifts at high altitudes. There is currently limited information from outlying terrain available to the Avalanche Warning Service."
