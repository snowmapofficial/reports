On very steep, smooth slopes such as meadows or sparse forest areas, small gliding avalanches can occasionally trigger themselves.\n\nAbove 2200 m, old snow can occasionally be problematic. With a large additional load, small slab avalanches can be triggered on extremely steep slopes in northern aspects."

Above 2200 m, only a few weak, built-up layers can be found in the upper half metre of the snow cover, snowpack on the shady slopes. The base of the snowpack is often wet. There is little snow, on the south side the ground is snowed out far up."
