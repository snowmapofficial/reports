The new snow and wind slabs of Tuesday are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in some places in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. On very steep slopes the avalanches can be triggered in the various layers of new snow and reach large size. <br/> Avalanches can be released, even by small loads in isolated cases, in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Whumpfing sounds and natural avalanches serve as an alarm sign. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection."
