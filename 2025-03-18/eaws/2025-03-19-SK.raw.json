Due to very strong winds, snow was transported to the leeward slopes of different orientations during the last snowfall.  Therefore, in steep slopes, troughs, under saddles and rock walls there are snow slabs and pillows which are not sufficiently bonded to the ground. Avalanche release in these areas is possible, especially with high additional loads. During the day, smaller spontaneous avalanches of wet snow may occur on sunlit slopes.",

In leeward places it reaches up to 30 cm in places, elsewhere it is completely absent and the surface is made up of older frozen snow. It will start to warm up significantly in the next few days, so the snow on the sunlit slopes will be temporarily damp to wet during the day. On north-facing slopes, the snow will remain dry, often deposited in slab and pillow forms. There is only patchy snow cover at elevations up to 1400m."
