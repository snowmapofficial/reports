        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground. Good visibility. Variable winds, 10mph or less.",
        "Comment": "Becoming unseasonably mild Thursday and Friday, with afternoon summit air temps likely around plus 7- 8C.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry with varying amounts of cloud during the day. The wind will remain light to moderate, Easterly initially, gradually veering West throughout the period. Cold overnight, milder through the day as the freezing level rises to around the summits p.m.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change expected. The very limited snow cover will re-freeze overnight, slowly thaw during the day and remain stable in all locations. Most snow will be found on permanently shaded terrain, mainly steep NW to NE aspects above 800 metres. The remnant patches of old snow will remain firm. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Dry with good sunny spells, but summit cloud at times mainly affecting the more coastal mountains. Light and variable wind. The freezing level was at, or just above the higher summits by midday.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry and settled conditions will continue to affect the area with an overnight frost at most levels. Clear and sunny through the day with light to moderate South to South-Westerly winds. It will remain cold in shaded areas  maintaining a firm and possibly icy surface on the remaining snow.",
        "SnowStability": "Cold conditions overnight will refreeze the remaining snow patches which mainly exist in sheltered hollows, gullies and steep corrie rims on Northerly to Easterly aspects above 850 metres. Through the day the surface of the snow patches exposed to the sun may soften but areas in the shade will remain firm and may be icy in places. Snow stability will remain generally good.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
