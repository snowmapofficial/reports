        "comment": "The sometimes moderate wind has transported the new snow. This snow as well as the wind slabs to be found above the tree line represent the main danger. The wind slabs are quite large can be released easily, especially on very steep slopes at intermediate and high altitudes adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Be careful, many rocks hidden by fresh snow. As a consequence of solar radiation, the natural avalanche activity will gradually increase. This applies in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2200 m, and in steep rocky terrain.",
