Whumpfing sounds serve as an alarm indicating the danger. On very steep sunny slopes the likelihood of avalanches will increase during the day. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution. Several small and medium-sized slab avalanches have been released by people in the last few days. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep sunny slopes small and medium-sized dry and moist snow slides are to be expected from the middle of the day, in particular at the base of rock walls, and in steep rocky terrain. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected at any time, in particular on extremely steep grassy slopes.",
