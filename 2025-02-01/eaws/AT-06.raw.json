Danger spots are predominately in entries and peripheral areas of extremly steep gullies and bowls in the north western to northeastern expositions.

In highe northwestern to eastern sectors older, predominantly sufficient settled snowdrift areas are existing which are on top of an old snow cover which is weakened due to kinetic metamorphosis (faceting). This combination can be prone to triggering. In steep sunny slopes on smooth surfaces or grass the wet snowcover can start gliding. Exposed area are often icy and hard."
