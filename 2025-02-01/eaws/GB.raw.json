        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will rise above summit levels overnight. It will becoming cooler on Sunday with freezing levels around 1000 metres. Mainly dry conditions are expected with only a trace of new snow on the highest slopes. Winds will be strong overnight becoming moderate to fresh variable Southerly to Westerly through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will moisten overnight with milder conditions. Stability will generally be good by day with a return to cooler temperatures. Isolated surface wet snow instabilities may exist on the steepest slopes and gullies but these should generally be avoidable. Cornices will remain suspect and prone to collapse.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

The snow will be generally stable with some minor surface instability possible in steeper wind sheltered locations above 900 metres on any aspect.
