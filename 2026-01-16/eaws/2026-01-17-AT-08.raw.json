Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. In addition, freshly generated snowdrifts in higher-altitude pass and ridgeline zones require caution. Activities in backcountry require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing avalanche danger."

Bonding of the most recent fresh snow and drifts to the often faceted, expansively metamorphosed old snowpack surface and inside the unfavorably structured layers of old snow continues to be moderate-to-weak. In addition, layers inside the fresh snow and drifted snow masses from last week are often still prone to triggering. Remote triggerings, settling noises, fractures on the surface continue to confirm the trigger-sensitivity."

Bonding to the often faceted, expansively metamorphosed snowpack surface and inside the unfavorably structured layers of old snow is often only moderate. In addition, layers inside the fresh snow and drifted snow from last week are often still prone to triggering. As a result of higher temperatures, the snow at low and intermediate altitudes is moistend and the snowpack surfact is melt-freeze encrusted in early morning. At low altitudes there is only little snow on the ground."
