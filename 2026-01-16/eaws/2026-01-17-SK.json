        "comment": "In the High , Western and Low Tatras it is valid at the highest altitudes - from 1700 m above sea level. MODERATE avalanche danger (i.e. 2nd degree of the 5-part scale). Significant snowfalls from the last snowfall period were often blown by strong winds up to the forest zone. However, on the leeward sides of the mountains (mainly SE and E), snow pillows and slabs are locally formed by the wind at the highest elevations, and their stability may be low, especially on steep to very steep slopes. Avalanches can be triggered locally, especially by large additional loads. At mid-altitudes the snow has settled and stabilised due to the temperature change. During the day, on sun-facing south-facing slopes, it will gradually become heavier, which will reduce its stability. During the day, small spontaneous avalanches may occur sporadically, mainly from wet snow.",
