Weak layers are mainly found in the old snowpack (unstable layer of faceted crystals). In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability. On the sunny slopes, the snowpack is again becoming more stable. A non-load-bearing crust has formed in the sunny slopes.\nDue to the wind from the south, fresh snowdrift accumulations are forming occasionally in the high alpine regions (Schladminger Tauern - Dachstein).\nThe snow depths are still below average."
