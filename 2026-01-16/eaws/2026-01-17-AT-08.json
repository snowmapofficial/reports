        "comment": "One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches in the old snow. When they sweep away the entire snowpack, the avalanches can grow to medium size. Danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. In addition, freshly generated snowdrifts in higher-altitude pass and ridgeline zones require caution. Activities in backcountry require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing avalanche danger.",
