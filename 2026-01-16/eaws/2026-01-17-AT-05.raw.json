      "comment" : "The risk of avalanches increases rapidly with altitude from around 1800 metres and is considerable above 2000 metres.\nSlab avalanches can be triggered in some places by small additional loads and can reach medium size. Avalanche prone locations are concentrated in the north-west to north-east facing steep terrain, but sometimes also in the east and south sectors, behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. They increase rapidly in size and frequency with altitude. The wind slabs are often located directly next to blown-off areas, are easily recognisable and should be avoided at all costs. Cracks and whumpfing collapsing sounds when walking on the snow cover, snowpack are a sign of danger."

      "comment" : "Under the influence of mild air and sunlight, the snow cover, snowpack has settled and become cardboardy up to around 2000 metres. It has at least a thin melt-freeze crust in the morning. In the wind slabs, fresh drift snow lies on a leeward layer of old snow that is often still soft in the higher altitudes and is prone to triggering. Further weak layers of faceted crystals and deep rime lie in the persistent weak layer below and can be activated occasionally by surface avalanches. The total snow depth is still well below average in many places. Broad ridge and ridges are often completely blown off."
