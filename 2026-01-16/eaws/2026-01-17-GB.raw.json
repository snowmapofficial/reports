        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable crust to approx 800m, very tiring conditions.  Clear in the morning with poor visibility in clouds in the afternoon. Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Consolidating trend in most snow though residual instability persisting in specific places.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Only a trace of snow is forecast. Moderate East-South-East winds. Freezing level rising slowly from 800m overnight to 1000m by dusk on Saturday.",
        "SnowStability": "Fluctuating temperatures expected to enhance the consolidating trend in most snow over the forecast period. However, localised instabilities will persist in deeper deposits of windslab on steepest North-West through North to East aspects above 950m; coire rims and gully exits being the most affected areas. Cornices may weaken later in the day.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Dry. Cold, though temperatures eased a little during the day. Light to moderate South-South-West winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Noticeably better bonded snow in many places especially at lower altitudes. Weaker windslab still present but now more localised and confined to the top of steep coire back walls and gully exits. Most affected areas are North-West through North to East aspects above 950m. Small to medium cornices in place above some of these places.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow above 700m, hard going off established trails. Cloudy on the tops, poor visibility during showers and from spindrift, some bright spells. Winds approx 10mph to 20mph.",
        "Comment": "Remaining dry with South or South-Easterly winds.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mainly dry and cloudy through the period with only an occasional light snow shower. Overnight the freezing level will be around 1000 metres, rising only slightly during the day to just above this altitude. East-South-East winds will be moderate to fresh.",
        "SnowStability": "Significant areas of unstable windslab will remain, particularly in gullies and around gully tops, above 1000 metres with North-West through North to East aspects most affected. Fragile cornices will be prone to collapse. Other aspects will be affected by cross loading. Below 1000 metres the snowpack will be moist and continue to slowly consolidate as the freezing level rises, with improving stability through the day. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Following a dry night it remained cloudy over the high summits with only isolated showers, falling as snow above 700 metres, during the morning. Winds were fresh to strong from Southerly directions with notable snow redistribution.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Deposits of poorly bonded windslab have continued to build on the already significant accumulations from yesterday, mainly on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. Cornices are fragile and prone to collapse, with collapsed debris witnessed during the morning. Other aspects are affected by cross loading. Below 900 metres the snowpack remains soft and moist with better stability. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",
