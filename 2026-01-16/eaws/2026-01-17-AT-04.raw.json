      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is predominantly classified as low. Slab avalanches of up to medium size can be triggered by large additional loads in only a few places in the terrain at high altitudes, in very to extremely steep terrain. There are avalanche prone locations mainly in areas adjacent to the ridgeline and in steep, filled-in bowls and gullies. Occasionally, small wet loose snow avalanches from extremely steep terrain cannot be completely ruled out."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snow cover, snowpack was able to settle with the mild temperatures and incoming radiation. Weak layers may still be present at high altitudes. The snow base, fundament is weakened by crystalline forms that have been transformed by building up. Depending on the hardness and aspect, the snow surface varies in hardness, sometimes crust can form and can soften somewhat, especially on sunny slopes."
