        "comment": "The avalanche danger is moderate above 1600 metres and low below that. The main problem at higher altitudes is a persistent weak layer. Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations are at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes.\n\nWet snow can also be problematic during daytime changes. Small, wet avalanches can detach themselves, especially when exposed to sunlight in very steep, extreme terrain.",
