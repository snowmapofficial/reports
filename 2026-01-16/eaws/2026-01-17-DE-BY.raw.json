      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is moderate above 1600 metres and low below that. The main problem at higher altitudes is a persistent weak layer. Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations are at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes.\n\nWet snow can also be problematic during daytime changes. Small, wet avalanches can detach themselves, especially when exposed to sunlight in very steep, extreme terrain."

At high altitudes, the snowpack base consists of faceted crystals. Up to medium elevations, the snow cover, snowpack is soaked through to the ground in many places. The snow surface is crusted can form in the morning and softens on the sunny slopes during the daytime changes."
