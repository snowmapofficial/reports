        "comment": "The small quantity of fresh snow and in particular the wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. The avalanches in these loacations are only small. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist loose snow avalanches are possible in all altitude zones. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",
