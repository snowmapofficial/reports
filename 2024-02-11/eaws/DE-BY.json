Wet-snow/glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on very steep slopes with smooth ground, grass-covered slopes and in forest clearances. Avoid zones below glide cracks. In addition, in extremely steep terrain at intermediate altitudes, wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally wherever there is sufficient snow on the ground, mostly small releases.\r\nIn isolated cases at high altitudes, snowdrift accumulations can trigger small slab avalanches by 1 person. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain on east-facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. The danger of falling generally outweighs that of being buried in snow.",
