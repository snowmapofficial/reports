        "Comment": "",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds will be generally South-Westerly, moderate overnight increasing to strong by mid afternoon. It will be dry overnight with some snow showers, possibly heavy late in the afternoon. Initially the freezing level will be around 800 metres but by midnight will have fallen to 600m where it will remain for the rest of the forecast period.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to stabilise overnight with isolated pockets of instability initially limited to steep terrain such as gully exits above 1000 metres on South-West to North-West aspects. Later in the day with the onset of snowfall and strengthening winds unstable windslab will begin to accumulate on North to East aspects above 900 metres.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The windslab on South-West to North-West aspects above 800 metres continues to stabilise and is now generally moderately well bonded. Other aspects are either scoured or have stable snow which is firm in many places.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "Some steep slopes are wind scoured with very firm snow ice, leading to serious run out potential into rocks below.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions up until the afternoon when snow showers are expected above 500 metres, these will be heaviest towards the end of the day.  Fresh to strong South-Westerly winds will increase strong to gale force through the afternoon and back to become South-South-Westerly. The freezing level will fall from 900 to 700 metres during the night.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be a redistribution of lying snow and later drifting of new snow.  New accumulations of windslab will develop on Northerly to Easterly aspects mostly above 900m. Areas most affected will be in wind sheltered terrain such as coire rims, gully tops and crag aprons.  Fragile cornices will also develop.  Snowpack weaknesses will persist at depth on West to North aspects above 1000m. Elsewhere the snowpack will be generally stable or wind scoured. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Windslab accumulations remain present on Westerly to Northerly aspects above 1000 metres; here weaknesses  persist at depth beneath the dense windslab.  The greatest instability is in areas of steep and convex wind sheltered terrain such as around coire rims, gully exits and crag aprons.  Elsewhere the snowpack is generally well bonded or firm and icy.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "A wintry day in prospect with continual snow fall. Scoured and firm snow in some areas will remain consequential due to the paucity of runouts.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Constant snow fall is expected from the early hours, this will be confined to above 600 metres initially, and above 400 metres later in the forecast period. The winds will be strong South-Westerlies overnight, becoming very strong and South-South-Westerly later. The freeing level will gradually fall to reside at 600 metres at midday.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will accumulate throughout the day on North-West through North to South-East aspects above 900 metres. These accumulations will be weak where they gain depth and overlie the older firm snowpack. Steep wind sheltered areas such as gully tops, gully sidewalls and scarp slopes will be affected. Areas exposed to the wind will be scoured, firm and stable. Elsewhere fresh snow will cover bare ground above 600 metres. Fresh cornices will develop. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A generally dry and bright day. Winds were initially light before increasing to strong South-Westerlies. The freezing level was around 900 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Moderately bonded windslab was present on North-West through North to South-East aspects above 900 metres. As the day progressed these accumulations gained depth due to redistribution of existing snow, particularly in steep wind sheltered locations such as in gully tops and scarp slopes. Outwith these areas the snowpack is very firm and disguised by a superficial covering of fresh snow. Limited cornice development was noted above a North-East aspect. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

Avalanches are likely in these locations, particularly during the afternoon. Fresh cornices will be prone to collapse. Windward aspects will be scoured and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Recent deposits of soft windslab are poorly bonded, particularly where they overlie the old hard and icy snowpack. This combination is mainly found on North to East aspects above 1000 metres. However, these soft deposits are not that extensive and are often avoidable. Two human triggered avalanches occurred today, both on separate North-Easterly aspects at altitudes of 1050 and 1100 metres respectively. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",
