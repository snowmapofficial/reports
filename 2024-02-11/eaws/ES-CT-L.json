        "comment": "The wind slabs of the last two days can be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanches are rather small but in many cases easily released. Individual medium-sized avalanches are nontheless possible. At high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides are to be expected in all altitude zones.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs represent the main danger. From the middle of the day moist snow slides are possible."
