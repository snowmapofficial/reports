Due to rising temperatures and lots of solar radiation, glide-snow avalanches continue to be the main danger: in all aspects at any time of day or night, medium-sized when triggering from terrain which has not yet discharged, plummeting down to greenlands, esp. in starting zones in NW/N/E facing terrain. Avoid zones below glide-cracks.\r\nAs the day progresses, likelihood of small loose-snow slides will increase on sunny slopes and in rough and rocky terrain in all aspects, esp. on very steep W/N/E facing slopes above 2200m.",

On steep wind-protected slopes in extended north-facing terrain, small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches are possible.\r\nThe danger of glide-snow avalanches is again increasing. They are possible in all aspects and at any time of day or night. In high starting zones which have not yet discharged they can be medium-sized and plummet down to greenlands, esp. from starting zones where there is still sufficient snow on the ground on N/E facing slopes. Avoid zones below glide cracks. \r\nAll backcountry activities should be terminated early in the day.",
