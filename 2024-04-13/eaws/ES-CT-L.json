        "comment": "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions, but the avalanche danger will increase later. On very steep sunny slopes small moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected above approximately 2000 m. Also on shady slopes small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist avalanches are possible below approximately 2300 m. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",

The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust only at high altitudes and will soften quickly. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes only a little snow is lying."
