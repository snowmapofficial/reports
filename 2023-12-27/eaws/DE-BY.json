The crust softens slowly during the course of day; in the shade it will mostly stay icy. Underneath the melt-freeze crust the snowpack is thoroughly moist and frequently wet down to the ground. Therefore, gliding movements over smooth ground are possible. On very steep shady slopes weak layers can still be found in isolated cases. Below 1400 m the ground is becoming bare. In the Bavarian Alps it is now almost impossible  to go backcountry skiing without having to carry the skis for part of the route."

Below approx. 2400 m possibility of glide snow avalanches on steep slopes with smooth ground and still enough snow. They can release in any aspect and at any time of day or night. At higher altitudes glide snow avalanches can grow to medium size; elsewhere they are mostly small. Glide cracks indicate danger zones. With increasing altitude there are isolated trigger-sensitive locations in the old snow where snow is rather shallow as well as at entries into gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches are mostly only triggerable by large additional loading, such as by a person walking on foot.  Slab avalanches can reach medium size.",
