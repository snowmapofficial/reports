        "SnowStability": "Weaknesses will persist in the deep accumulations of windslab that remain mostly above 800m on W through N to NE aspects. Additionally, new snow with redistributed deposits will form new windslab on North-West to North-Easterly aspects above 800m. Coire back walls and rims, gully tops and ridge flanks most affected. Below this level, stability will generally improve, some weaknesses may linger in deeper deposits above 600m on same aspects. Weak Cornices. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable",

In other places there is a thin cover on bare ground or wind scoured terrain.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable",

A lot of the new snow fall was whipped away in the very strong winds resulting in more snow accumulations at lower elevations.",
