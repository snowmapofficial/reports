Avalanches can grow to medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks.\r\nWeak layers in the old snow above 2800 m can be triggered in a few danger zones, mostly by large additional loading (group, collapsing cornice), avalanches can grow to medium size, danger zones increase with ascending altitiude.",
