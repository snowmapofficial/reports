The freezing level rises by morning to around the highest summits with sleat and snow showers continuing above 900 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: Mainly dry and cloudy with periods of brightness and a few light isolated showers. Moderate Southerly winds with the freezing level around the highest summits.\nObservedSnowStability: A light dusting of overnight snow above 900 metres landing almost completely on bare ground. Only very few isolated patches of wet snow remain. This is insufficient to warrant an avalanche hazard category. For further information please refer to the SAIS mountain blog."
