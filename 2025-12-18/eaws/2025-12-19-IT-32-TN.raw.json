The wind slabs are mostly shallow and in some cases prone to triggering. These are clearly recognisable. <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. <br/> Mostly avalanches are small."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"<br/> Up to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Tuesday above approximately 2000 m. The wind slabs of the last few days remain in some cases prone to triggering in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> Shady slopes above approximately 2600 m: Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> In all regions less snow than usual is lying.
