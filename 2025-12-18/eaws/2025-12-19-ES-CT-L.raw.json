On wind-loaded slopes small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized dry avalanches are possible. In particular in the south and in the east and above approximately 2200 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. In the northern half of Aran these avalanche prone locations are more rare and the danger is lower. Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for caution and restraint. <br/> <br/> In particular steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible in all altitude zones."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"In the past few hours the wind was moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines in particular in the south and in the southwest. The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. The wind slabs are lying on unfavourable layers in particular on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. <br/> <br/> Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be good over a wide area. Sunny slopes as well as low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Gradual decrease in danger of moist avalanches as the temperature drops.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-19T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-20T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-19"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","E","W"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","E"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["S","SW","W","SE"]}],"bulletinID":"37c7d82f-a5fe-4fad-8cd1-928b7845f94c","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
