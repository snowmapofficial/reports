Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The rain gave rise during the course of the night to slight softening of the snowpack. <br/> Shady slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 50 to 60 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
