        "comment": "From the early morning as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist snow slides. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls.",

At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
