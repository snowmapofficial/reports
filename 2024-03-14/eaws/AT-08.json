        "comment": "Fresh snow and drifts on high shady slopes and at high altitudes are prone to triggering. Danger zones occur near ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small-to-medium slab avalanches and also loose-snow avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In high-alpine regions the situation is more crditical. Due to solar radiation and rising daytime temperatures, wet slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. on very steep rocky slopes. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger at any time of day or night and grow to larger size.",
