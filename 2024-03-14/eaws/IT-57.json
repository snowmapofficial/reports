In gullies and bowls and on steep sunny slopes the danger of moist and wet avalanches is a little higher. This applies in particular on east, south and west facing slopes.",

Further warming: These weather conditions will give rise to gradual moistening of the snowpack in particular on east, south and east facing slopes."
