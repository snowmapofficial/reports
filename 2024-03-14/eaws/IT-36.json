In addition the wind slabs must be taken into account. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day, the likelihood of wet avalanches being released will increase gradually in all regions. Snow slides and natural avalanches are still possible. This applies in particular in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Avalanches can as before be released, in particular by large loads.",

In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard crust. The weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to increasing softening of the snowpack. This applies in particular on sunny slopes. In some places wind slabs are lying on a hard crust. In addition large wind slabs formed also adjacent to ridgelines."
