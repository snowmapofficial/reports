      "comment" : "As the moisture increases more gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible from the early morning, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. In the afternoon as a consequence of the rain there will be a significant increase in the danger. The old wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep, little used north facing slopes and at elevated altitudes. They are easy to recognise but can in some cases be released easily especially at their margins. Sometimes they are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The wind slabs are to be avoided as far as possible in particular on very steep shady slopes. The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The old wind slabs are lying on weak layers in particular on wind-protected shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations indicate this situation. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be reduced. These spring-like weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to rapid moistening of the snowpack in all aspects in particular at low and intermediate altitudes. As a consequence of the rain the prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase in the afternoon. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 90 to 130 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitude snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
