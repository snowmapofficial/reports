        "SnowDistribution": "Snowpack surface generally soft, some icy patches remain, including on higher paths and the plateau.  Clear in the morning with poor visibility at summit levels during the afternoon. Calm conditions.",
        "Comment": "Remaining cooler for the next couple of days.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snowfall is expected above 900 metres then later 800 metres throughout the forecast period.  This will be heaviest during the daylight hours.  Fresh Easterly winds will back to become Northerly in direction during the morning.  The 1000 metre freezing level will fall to 800 metres by dawn.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of unstable windslab will develop on South-East to South-West aspects above 900 metres.  These will be more isolated on West to North-West aspects.  The greatest instability will be were accumulations gain depth, especially around corrie rims, crag aprons and gully exits.  Fragile cornices will develop on these aspects.  Elsewhere the old snowpack will be firm and stable.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A dry morning with occasional light snow showers during the afternoon. Winds were light South-Easterly.  The midday freezing level was just below the summits.",

The greatest accumulations remain around coire back walls on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres.  Cornices overhang North-West to North aspects.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
