During the day: Fresh wind slabs at the southern border of Aran.","comment":"As the penetration by moisture increases there will be a gradual increase in the danger of gliding avalanches to level 2 (moderate). Some small and medium-sized avalanches are to be expected. In addition as the day progresses some small moist snow slides are possible. They can be released by a single winter sport participant or triggered naturally. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects below approximately 2300 m. <br/> <br/> Southern and eastern borders of Aran, Above the tree line: The fresh wind slabs are easy to recognise and prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Monday: The weather will be cloudy. The wind will be moderate to strong. <br/> During the day: Some snow will fall. In particular at the southern border of Aran 5 to 10 cm of snow will fall above approximately 2000 m. The southerly wind will transport the new snow. <br/> <br/> Low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The avalanche danger will persist.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-15T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-16T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-15"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{"upperBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","SW","S","SE","E","W"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{"upperBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","SW","S","SE","E","W"]},{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"treeline"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","N","E","W"]}],"bulletinID":"cd19eca6-525b-4a2e-ab00-1ddd966cd80c","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"upperBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
