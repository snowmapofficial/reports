There is particularly little snow on the southern flank of the Alps and at intermediate altitudes on the eastern part of the northern flank of the Alps. Weak layers in the snowpack are located in particular on northern and eastern slopes above approximately 2400 m. Hardly any avalanches have been triggered in the last four days, except in southern Lower Valais. Here, human activity has triggered isolated avalanches in the weak old snowpack.</p><p>Below approximately 2800 m, the surface of the snowpack is stable on very steep southern slopes, otherwise it is mostly brittle. Only on north-facing slopes sheltered from the wind is there still some loose, faceted snow at high altitudes. With increasing southerly winds, Monday will see small local snowdrift accumulations build up over the course of the day.</p><p>Isolated wet snow slides and gliding avalanches are possible with the sunshine and rising temperatures during the daytime.</p>"
