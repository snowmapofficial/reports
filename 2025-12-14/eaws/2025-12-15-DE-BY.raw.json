At high altitudes, small slab avalanches can occasionally be triggered in very steep terrain in northern exposures with high additional loads.\n  \nIn addition, individual, small sliding snow avalanches can be triggered on extremely steep sunny slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged."

Under the snow cover, the accumulating transformation is progressing, especially on shady slopes. Above 2000 m, the upper half metre of the snow cover on the shaded side is still partially covered with snow. However, snowpack tests show that large-scale break propagation is no longer to be expected. The base of the snowpack is partially wet. On the south side, the ground is increasingly pitting in the middle layers."
