With sunny weather and a relatively warm air mass at high altitudes, some small avalanches of wet snow may still spontaneously occur during the day on steep slopes, but avalanches are unlikely in most areas.\nIn arid areas above the tree line, weak layers are present in the snow cover. In a few places, a small, clustered avalanche may be triggered under higher loads.",
