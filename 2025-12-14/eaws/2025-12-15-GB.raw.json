        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will remain patchy with the greatest deposits being found on North to East aspects above 1000 metres. It will be hard, icy and stable. Any fresh deposits are not expected to the significant. The avalanche hazard will be Low",

        "SnowDistribution": "Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 60-75 mph with strong downslope gusts, serious conditions. Diminishing snowpack, the greatest cover is 1000 metres.",
        "Comment": "Colder temperatures will resume, resulting in a firm snow surface and the potential for ice underfoot above 850 metres.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds will be mostly from the South-South-West, storm force overnight but decreasing to become strong by dawn. A period of rain is expected overnight, with a short period of sleet and snow at summit level. The freezing level will drop to 1000 metres, rising to 1200 metres at the end of the period.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will be firm, well bonded and stable. The greatest extents will remain in high north facing coires, in areas such as back walls, ridge flanks and plateau areas above 1000 metres. A trace of fresh snow may be present at summit level, although this is not expected to be significant. Elsewhere, firm snow patches will remain. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Storm to gale force winds from the South-South-West for much of the period. A maximum summit gust of 116 mph was recorded on Cairn Gorm overnight. A period of rain was followed by showers during the day. The freezing level was around 2500 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded and stable, with a soft surface. The greatest extents remain confined to coire back walls, ridge flanks and plateau areas above 1000 metres. Elsewhere isolated snow patches and ribbons are becoming increasingly depleted, extensive bare ground abounds. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
