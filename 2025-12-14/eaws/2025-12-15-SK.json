        "comment": "In all mountain ranges where there is still a continuous snow cover (High, Low, Western Tatras) a moderate avalanche danger is declared. Due to the previous cold snap (Thursday, Friday), the snow cover has stabilised. Significant warming will cause the situation on sunlit slopes to worsen during the day, wet snow will be a problem even at the highest altitudes. Avalanches are possible especially on sunny slopes. Spontaneous wet avalanches from warming may occur.",
        "highlights": "Beware of significant warming at high altitudes, this may occasionally cause wet avalanches."

Continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1200 m and reaches 50 to 80 cm at the highest altitudes.  In the Western and High Tatras the snow is from about 1500 m above sea level and mostly reaches only 50 cm."
