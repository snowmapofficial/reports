        "comment": "Avalanches can be triggered in the persistent weak layer in isolated cases above about 2400m on very steep shady slopes. These releases usually are small-sized. The risks of injuries from being forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. As a result of daytime warming and solar radiation, isolated, generally small-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible on steep smooth slopes which have not yet discharged. Glide cracks are signals of possibly imminent danger.",
