In a few places, mainly small avalanches can be triggered by people.\nSmall sliding snow avalanches are possible from very steep, not yet unloaded grass mat terrain."

Below this, the snowpack is stable and sometimes glides on a smooth surface. The snow depths at all altitudes are well below the expected long-term values, and on the sunny side it is snow-free far up."
