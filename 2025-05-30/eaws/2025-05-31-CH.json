        "comment": "<h1 contenteditable=\"false\">Snowpack</h1><p>With new fallen snow and strong winds from the north, snowdrift accumulations formed in the high alpine regions on Thursday. Some of these are still prone to triggering on shady slopes. Older and newer drift snow layers lie below 3000 m on a saturated and consolidated old snowpack. On north-facing slopes above approximately 3000 m and in other aspects above around 3500 m, they often lie on top of a a still dry snowpack. Last week, ski tourers triggered several large avalanches in the high Alpine regions. This indicates that distinct weak layers were present in places in the dry old snowpack and these are likely to remain prone to triggering.</p><p>As temperatures rise in the sunshine, the snowpack will become increasingly moist even in the high alpine regions. With the first moistening of the dry layers of snow in the high alpine regions, the probability of avalanches being triggered will increase during the course of the day. Naturally triggered wet avalanches, some of which may carry along the entire snowpack with them, are also to be expected as the day progresses.</p>"

During the day, it will remain cloudy and there will be frequent showers, with heavy thunderstorms at times. The snowfall level will be around 3200 m. The wind will be mostly moderate from westerly directions.</p><p>The danger of dry avalanches will increase slightly in the vicinity of peaks in the high alpine regions, but elsewhere it will not change significantly. With the lack of sun and the rain falling up into the high alpine regions, the danger of wet avalanches will increase even during the night.
