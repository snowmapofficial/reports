        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. Dry avalanches can in some places be released by small loads. These can in isolated cases penetrate deep layers and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.",
