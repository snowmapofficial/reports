        "SnowDistribution": "Significant snow loss overnight, especially at lower elevations and where cover was thin.  Cloud base was at 900 metres, gradually rising during the afternoon.  Winds 30 - 40 mph, with stronger gusts during the morning gradually easing.",
        "Comment": "The mild conditions will continue to deplete the existing snowpack, accelerated with any rainfall.  Rock fall will remain a threat during this mild spell of weather.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Remaining mild with the freezing level above the highest summits. Some occasional light rain is possible through the day. South-South-West winds will increase through the evening becoming gale force at midday.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will continue to consolidate in the mild weather having good stability throughout. Greatest amounts will be found above 900 metres on mainly North-West through North-East to South-East aspects. Below this height the snow will be confined to patches and thin ribbons.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mild and dry day with the freezing level predominantly above the summits. Gale force winds eased at midday to become moderate in strength from the South-West.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining snowpack, although moist, is stable and generally well bonded.  Greatest accumulations are on North-West through North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Mild with rain at all levels. The snowpack will further reduce and become soft and wet throughout. General snowpack stability will be good but wet snow instabilities will exist on the steepest slopes where deeper accumulations of snow exist. These conditions will mainly be found in sheltered summit gullies and on slopes with a North to East aspect above 850 metres. Isolated remaining cornices will be prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
