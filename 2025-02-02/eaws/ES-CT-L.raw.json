These can in isolated cases penetrate deep layers and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution."

      "comment" : "Shady slopes: The covering of new snow is dry; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow. In its middle, the snowpack is faceted and weak. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep slopes. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
