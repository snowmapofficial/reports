On very steep sunny slopes the likelihood of avalanches will increase during the day. <br/> In isolated cases the avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach quite a large size. Whumpfing sounds serve as an alarm indicating the danger. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep sunny slopes more frequent small and medium-sized moist avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses. Gliding avalanches can also occur at any time, in particular on extremely steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m.",
