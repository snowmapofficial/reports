The snow on shady side slopes is powdery, in exposed locations wind-compacted. The snowpack base is partly wet. Therefore, gliding movements of the snowpack cannot be exlcuded."

Isolated patches where avalanches can be released are located at transitions from shallow to deep snow in extremely steep W/N/E-facing terrain. In most cases, avalanches will only be released by large additional loading. In addition, isolated glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally. This can happen in all aspects on very steep grass-covered slopes. Such glide-snow avalanches are mostly small; however, very isolated medium-sized releases cannot be excluded.",
