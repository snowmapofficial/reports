The fresh wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence. Skiers can release avalanches in isolated cases, including medium-sized ones. Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2600 m. <br/> Older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads,.
