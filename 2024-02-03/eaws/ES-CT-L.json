        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist snow slides being released will increase for a while in particular on very steep sunny slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. Extremely steep grassy slopes and steep terrain that is interspersed with rocks: A latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. The avalanches are rather small.",
        "highlights": "The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable. Gliding avalanches and moist loose snow slides are possible from the middle of the day in isolated cases."

At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
