        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2200 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Mostly small snowdrift accumulations are often trigger-prone at high altitudes. Danger zones occur near ridges on NW/N/SE facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. In addition, there are weak layers in the uppermost level of the snowpack at high altitudes, prone to triggering, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow or on heavily wind-loaded slopes. Avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading and grow to medium size. Backcountry sports require prudent route selection.  Caution urged near cornices. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
