A snowpit was taken in Bl\u00e1fj\u00f6ll on the 30th of January in a NW facing aspect. There was dominantly driftsnow with thin layers of hail in between. Extented column tests showed a failure at high load (ECTN26 @80cm). Snow accummulation has been very localized the last weeks and chances are of thick windslabs after constant SW winds during the weekend."

Compression test gave straight fracture by medium stress in the new windslabs (CT13/15@56cm). Most likely it melted in the upper part of the snowpack on Friday before it froze again but deeper layers were likely not affected by the warmth.
