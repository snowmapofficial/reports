Small loose-snow slides can release in steep rocky terrain on sunny slopes. On very steep slopes with smooth ground (grass-covered slopes or forest clearances) isolated glide-snow avalanches can trigger, medium-sized releases can\u2019t be excluded.\r\nIsolated small older snowdrift accumulations can be problematic at high altitudes, mostly triggerable by large additional loading on extremely steep shady ridgeline slopes or in transitions from shallow to deeper snow.

        "comment": "As a result of higher temperatures during the daytime hours and cooling during the nocturnal hours, the snowpack is stabilizing, becoming compact and increasingly hard. Layers inside the snowpack are dissolving, at intermediate altitudes the snowpack consists of melted forms, is thoroughly wet down to the ground. Gliding movements over slopes with smooth ground are possible. Due to sunshine and higher temperatures the surface becomes moist during the daytime hours, forfeits its firmness. In shady summit terrain, small snowdrift accumulations can trigger from place to place. In addition, in the uppermost part of the snowpack there are layers of faceted crystals between melt-freeze crusts. Below 1300 m there is hardly any snow on the ground."
