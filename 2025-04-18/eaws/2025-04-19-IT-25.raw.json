      "comment" : "Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m many wet slab avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. These can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size also in the regions with a lot of snow. <br/> Fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring. As a consequence of the new snow dry and moist avalanches are possible, even quite large ones. As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, extensive wind slabs formed above approximately 2600 m. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily in some places especially on very steep shady slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Avalanches can in isolated cases reach large size. <br/> <br/> Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes below approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. As a consequence of warming during the day there will be only a slight increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow. <br/> <br/>"

      "comment" : "Individual weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Avalanches can in isolated cases be triggered in the old snowpack and reach quite a large size. The rain gave rise to a loss of strength within the snowpack below approximately 2600 m. Already many wet avalanches have been released in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes. The snowpack will be wet all the way through. This applies on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as on sunny slopes below approximately 3000 m. On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is now lying. The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already be soft in the early morning. <br/> High Alpine regions: The weather effects will foster a gradual strengthening of the snow drift accumulations."
