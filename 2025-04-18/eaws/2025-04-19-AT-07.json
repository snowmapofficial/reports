The snowpack will be wet all the way through. This applies on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as on sunny slopes below approximately 3000 m. On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is now lying. As a consequence of low temperatures the snowpack will consolidate during the course of the night. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, wind slabs formed in isolated cases. The weather effects will bring about a substantial strengthening of the snow drift accumulations."
