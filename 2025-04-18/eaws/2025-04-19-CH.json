In the inneralpine regions of Grisons in particular, where there has been only little fresh snow, weak layers in the old snowpack are still sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes in the high alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 2800 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to around 2400 m. At intermediate altitudes, the fresh snow fell widely on snowless ground. As a consequence of warming and solar radiation, wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected, in the fresh snow areas also at medium altitudes.
