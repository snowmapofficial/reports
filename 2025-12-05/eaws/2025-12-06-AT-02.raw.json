Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain in high Alpine regions. Avalanches are rather small. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Little snow has fallen. As a consequence of a light to moderate wind, small wind slabs formed in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> In some cases various wind slab layers are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack.
