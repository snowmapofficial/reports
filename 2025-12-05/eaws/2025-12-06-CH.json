In the west, these are heavily overlaid and therefore only triggered occasionally. In the other regions, they are closer to the surface. However, the overlying layers have since undergone a structural transformation and have become softer. For this reason, only isolated fractures have been reported here as well.</p><p>In many places, there is some loose fresh snow lying on the surface from the last 3 days and some surface hoar (hoar frost). These will be transported on Saturday during the course of the day.</p>"
