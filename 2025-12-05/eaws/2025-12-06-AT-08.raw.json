They have now been blanketed by fresh snowfall, making them difficult to recognize. Small-to-medium sized slab triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts. In addition, slab avalanches can be unleashed in parts of the old snowpack by large additional loading. Caution urged on high-altitude very steep shady slopes. Naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are still possible over smooth grass-covered ground and rock plates."

As a result of increasing westerly winds, the loosely-packed fresh snow will be transported during the course of the day, generating mostly small, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations. Particularly in high-altitude ridgeline terrain, these will often be deposited on top of surface hoar. With ascending altitude, small-sized older snowdrifts are still prone to triggering. At high altitudes, especially on shady slopes, faceted intermediate layers occur inside the snowpack, and can be triggered in some places."

Older snowdrift accumulations can still be triggered, particularly on shady slopes at high altitudes. Due to shallow snow depths, avalanches will remain small. Apart from being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to fall also require caution. Particularly on slopes where the ground is smooth and over rock plates, naturally triggered small-sized avalanches continue to be possible."
