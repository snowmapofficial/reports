        "comment": "The avalanche danger is moderate above 2400 metres and low below that. The main problem is slab avalanches in old snow, which can still be triggered by individual winter sports enthusiasts in the west, north and east exposures, especially at transitions from little to lots of snow. In addition, fresh drift snow packs can still be triggered in the extended northern sector, which are thinly covered with snow. Danger spots are located here particularly in the entrance areas of gullies and hollows as well as behind terrain edges. The avalanches usually remain small, but can occasionally break through into the old snow and become medium-sized.\nBelow 2800 m, small gliding snow avalanches can still spontaneously occur. Avoid areas underneath sliding snow pockets.",
