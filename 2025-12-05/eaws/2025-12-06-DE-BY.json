Danger spots are in steep terrain close to the crest with exposures from north-west to north to south-east as well as in gullies and hollows. The drifting snow can be triggered as a mostly small slab avalanche with a small additional load.\n\nSmall, spontaneous sliding snow avalanches are also possible below 2000 metres. Very steep slopes with smooth ground such as meadows, forest aisles and rock slabs are affected. Areas below sliding snow cracks should be avoided.",
