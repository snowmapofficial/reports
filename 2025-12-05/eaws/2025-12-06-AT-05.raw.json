The main problem is slab avalanches in old snow, which can still be triggered by individual winter sports enthusiasts in the west, north and east exposures, especially at transitions from little to lots of snow. In addition, fresh drift snow packs can still be triggered in the extended northern sector, which are thinly covered with snow. Danger spots are located here particularly in the entrance areas of gullies and hollows as well as behind terrain edges. The avalanches usually remain small, but can occasionally break through into the old snow and become medium-sized.\nBelow 2800 m, small gliding snow avalanches can still spontaneously occur. Avoid areas underneath sliding snow pockets."

In windless areas, the old snow surface is still loose or covered with surface frost. On the sunny side, the old snow cover is set far up and can be hardened. In very steep grass mat terrain, the snow cover is partly sliding off the ground."
