Danger spots for this are located particularly on steep slopes with exposures from west to north to east, especially at the transitions from little to much snow as well as behind terrain edges and near ridges. Slab avalanches in fresh and older drift snow can become medium-sized when breaking through into deeper layers. Some of the danger spots are covered in snow and difficult to recognise!\nWith the rain, more small sliding snow avalanches are possible again. Areas under sliding snow avalanches should be avoided.

On the one hand, the precipitation puts additional stress on existing weak layers, on the other hand, the rain causes the snow slab to form better on the weak layer, making it more susceptible to disruption for winter sports enthusiasts. The old snow cover contains several layers of angular crystals, which are susceptible to disruption. These can be found in particular on the western, northern and eastern slopes above 2400 metres. In addition, there are fresh and older accumulations of drift snow on soft layers that are prone to disturbance. In the steep grass mat terrain, the entire snow cover slides off the ground."
