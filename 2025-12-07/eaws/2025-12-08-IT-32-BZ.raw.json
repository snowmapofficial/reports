Weakly bonded old snow requires caution.","comment":"The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on steep shady slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2400 m. Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> In some cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"In some regions up to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall. The sometimes storm force wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on wind-protected shady slopes. They are prone to triggering. <br/> Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist deeper in the old snowpack in particular on steep shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The high temperatures will give rise to rapid moistening of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. From a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The weather will be mild.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-08T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-09T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-08"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":["DP6","DP1"]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["E","W","NE","N","NW"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"fair","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["E","W","NE","NW","N"]}],"bulletinID":"360928ef-ec64-40cd-9075-887352baf3da","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2400"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Lasörling Group","regionID":"AT-07-25"},{"name":"Schober Group West","regionID":"AT-07-28"},{"name":"Goldried","regionID":"AT-07-26-02"},{"name":"Glockner Group South","regionID":"AT-07-26-01"},{"name":"Pfunderer Mountains East","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-10"},{"name":"Langtaufers","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-02-01"},{"name":"Durreck Range","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-11"},{"name":"Upper Ahr Valley","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-05-03"},{"name":"Stubai Alps South","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-04-01"},{"name":"Rieserferner Mountains","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-12"},{"name":"Zillertal Alps South","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-05-02"},{"name":"Pfitsch","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-05-01"},{"name":"Sesvenna Group South","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-01-02"},{"name":"Schnals Ridge","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-03"},{"name":"Ortler Range","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-14"},{"name":"Sesvenna Group North","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-01-01"},{"name":"Planeil Mountains","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-02-02"},{"name":"Saldurn-Mastaun Ridge","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-06"},{"name":"Upper Passeier Valley","regionID":"IT-32-BZ-07-01"}]},{"publicationTime":"2025-12-07T16:00:00Z","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-07T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-08T16:00:00Z"},"unscheduled":false,"avalancheActivity":{"highlights":"Slight increase in danger of moist snow slides as a consequence of warming.","comment":"As a consequence of warming, the likelihood of moist snow slides during the day being released will increase a little, in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes, and at the base of rock walls. <br/> Avalanches can additionally in very isolated cases be released on extremely steep shady slopes.
