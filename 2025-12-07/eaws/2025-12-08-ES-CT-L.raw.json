Sometimes they are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2000 m. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. They can be released by people or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> In addition the old wind slabs of the last few days in the vicinity of peaks are capable of being triggered in very isolated cases still. They must be evaluated with care and prudence at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for meticulous route selection. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. Early morning: In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"As a consequence of rain up to high altitudes a crust formed on the surface on Saturday. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on very steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will hardly soften at all. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Hardly any decrease in danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides until the temperature drops.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-08T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-09T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-08"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{"upperBound":"2500"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["NE","SW","NW","W","S","SE","E"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["SW","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"f643e30b-89e7-4695-a8cd-8da1758eb52b","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"upperBound":"2500"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2500"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
