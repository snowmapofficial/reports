Small to medium-sized snow slabs and loose snow avalanches can detach spontaneously during precipitation. Slab avalanches can also be triggered by individual winter sports enthusiasts with little additional pressure. Danger spots for this are located particularly on steep slopes with exposures from west to north to east, especially at the transitions from little to much snow as well as behind terrain edges and near ridges. Slab avalanches in fresh and older drift snow can become medium-sized when breaking through into deeper layers. Some of the danger spots are covered in snow and difficult to recognise!\nWith the rain, more small sliding snow avalanches are possible again. Areas under sliding snow avalanches should be avoided. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling should also be taken into account!",

Monday will then start with poor visibility. The precipitation will largely subside by midday and the sun may appear from time to time. The wind will blow partly briskly from westerly directions and reach speeds of around 50 km/h, weakening during the day. Temperatures will rise to +4 degrees at 2000 metres and to -1 degree at 3000 metres."
