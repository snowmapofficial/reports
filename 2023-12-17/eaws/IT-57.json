        "comment": "Thus far only isolated small avalanches are possible. The small wind slabs represent the main danger. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above approximately 1800 m and on south and southwest facing slopes. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard crust.",
