These can especially at their margins be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming more loose snow avalanches are to be expected, but they will be mostly small. In addition an appreciable danger of gliding avalanches exists. This applies on steep slopes below approximately 2400 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. Avalanches can reach large size in isolated cases."
