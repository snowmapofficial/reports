Especially on very steep slopes and in shady places that are protected from the wind dry snow slides are to be expected. The avalanches are rather small. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can be released in particular on steep shady slopes at high altitude. In particular adjacent to ridgelines these are in some cases medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Careful route selection is important. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
