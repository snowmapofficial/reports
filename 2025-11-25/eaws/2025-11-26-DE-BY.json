        "comment": "The avalanche danger in the western Bavarian Alpine regions is considerable above the tree line and moderate below it. Fresh snow is the main problem. In the area of the tree line and above, it can be triggered in places as a medium slab avalanche by a small additional load where it comes to rest in a bound state. The main danger spots are in steep terrain close to the crest and in gullies and hollows. Avalanches can also trigger weak layers in old snow on shady slopes. From extremely steep terrain, fresh snow can also release itself as a small or medium-sized loose snow avalanche.\nOn very steep, smooth meadow slopes and in deciduous forests, smaller sliding snow avalanches can also release themselves.",
