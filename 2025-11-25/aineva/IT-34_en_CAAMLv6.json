The wind was strong. <br/> The new snow can be released naturally in all aspects above the tree line. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found especially at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Mostly the avalanches in these loacations are small. <br/> The sometimes strong wind has transported some snow. In particular adjacent to ridgelines wind slabs formed. <br/> The sometimes deep wind slabs represent the main danger. They can be released even by a single winter sport participant above approximately 2000 m. <br/> In particular on very steep slopes and adjacent to ridgelines medium-sized slab avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and wind."
