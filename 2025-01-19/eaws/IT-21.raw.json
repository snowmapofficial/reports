Gradual increase in avalanche danger as the snowfall becomes more intense. <br/> <br/> In isolated cases the dry avalanches are large and can be released easily by a single winter sport participant, caution is to be exercised in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2100 m. <br/> <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. <br/> Avalanches can be released in near-ground layers and reach quite a large size. This applies in particular in little used terrain along the border with France. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection."
