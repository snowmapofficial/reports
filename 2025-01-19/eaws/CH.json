Hardly any avalanches starting in weak layers in the near-ground old snowpack are to be expected.</li><li>South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, at high altitude there are distinct weak layers in the snowpack In these, avalanches can still be triggered in places, sometimes reaching down to the ground. In central and southern Ticino, as well as in Val Bregaglia and Val Poschiavo, there is so little old snow that avalanches can usually only be triggered in these layers above approximately 2600 m. The thin snowpack is increasingly transforming into faceted crystals, which reduces the probability of avalanches being triggered and makes sinking to the ground increasingly possible.</li></ul>"
