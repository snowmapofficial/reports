        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow throughout. Cloudy on the tops with some occasional bright spells. Winds 20 -30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Some uncertainty over snowfall amount, hazard might be Low if less than expected snowfall occurs.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will be around 700 metres with the near gale force South-Westerly winds. Overnight snow showers will die out through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will freeze and become hard, icy and stable. Fresh areas of unstable windslab will be deposited in sheltered North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Coire rims and the tops of gullies will be most affected. In general these areas will not be extensive, and should be generally avoidable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The well consolidated snowpack is wet throughout. During the afternoon it started to turn firm and icy at higher levels. Stability was good throughout. There were some fresh deposits at higher levels, but these are not substantial. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "New overnight snowfall is expected to be light, however there is a possibility of heavier snow, particularly towards our Northern boundary. Consult North Cairngorms SAIS if heading to main Cairngorms.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Cold overnight with the freezing level settling around 700 metres during the day. Overnight, light snow is expected, dry thereafter. Strong winds, occasionally from the West but mostly West-South-West.",

        "SnowStability": "A return to colder conditions will start to re-freeze the older snowpack giving good general stability. New snow and wind transport of existing overnight snow will form localised areas of windslab in sheltered locations. Most affected will be summit gullies and steep slopes with a North through East to South-Easterly aspect mainly above 850 metres where old re-frozen snow underlies windslab. Small fragile cornices may also form in these areas.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Localised accumulations of unstable windslab will develop mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres, these will be more isolated on South-East aspects. The greatest instability will be where accumulations gain depth in wind sheltered locations such as crag aprons, corrie rims, ridge flanks and gully tops. Fragile cornices will develop.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
