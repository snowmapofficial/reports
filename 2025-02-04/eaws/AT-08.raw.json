      "comment" : "In some places avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier, generate medium-sized releases, mostly above 2000m in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are possible. Caution urged below glide cracks. Due to daytime warming and solar radiation, increasingly frequent loose-snow slides are possible, particularly on steep sunny slopes."

Highly diverse snowpack surface are evident, there is still powder on shady wind-protected slopes, otherwise wind crusts. On steep sunny slopes a melt-freeze crust is evident. Encrusted snowpack surfaces moisten during the day."
