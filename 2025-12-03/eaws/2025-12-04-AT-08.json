In addition, small-sized snowdrift accumulations occur in ridgeline terrain and behind protruberances in the landscape at increasing frequency with ascending altitude, these drifts are prone to triggering. Small-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts. Especially on steep grass-covered slopes, small-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible. Be careful beneath glide cracks.",
