Weakly bonded old snow at elevated altitudes.","comment":"The fresh and older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In very isolated cases avalanches can also be released in near-ground layers, in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Steep, glaciated terrain must also be critically assessed."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"A little snow is lying. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be in most cases soft. Towards its base, the snowpack consists of faceted crystals.
