In the sectors from west to north to east and in gullies, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by even a small additional load. They can occasionally break through to deeper weak layers and become medium sized if the snow is thick enough. Danger spots are mainly located close to the crest, directly on the main ridge also behind terrain edges far from the crest. Below 2800 m, mostly small sliding snow avalanches can occur spontaneously."

      "comment" : "Some brisk southerly winds have worked the snow surface at high altitudes and formed drift snow on a small scale. Away from the influence of the wind, the snow surface is often loose on the shaded side. Overblown, loose snow and angular crystals in the old snow are possible fracture surfaces. On the sunny side, the snow cover has settled a long way up and may have hardened in the morning. In the very steep grassy terrain, it sometimes slides along the ground."
