In other regions, snow depths are average to slightly below average. Especially on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m and generally in high Alpine regions, there are faceted, long-lasting weak layers deep in the old snowpack. In many places in western regions with heavy snow, these layers are overlaid with deep fresh snow and so can no longer be easily triggered by winter sports participants. However, if avalanches are triggered in these deep layers, they can become large. In other regions, the weak old snowpack layers are closer to the surface. Here the snowpack, which is mostly still very thin, is becoming completely faceted and loose, meaning that here too avalanches can only be triggered in places.</p><p>This week's mostly small snowdrift accumulations are in some cases still prone to triggering.
