The wind slabs of last week must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep north and east facing slopes above approximately 2500 m, in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases and mostly by large additional loads in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the high Alpine regions, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
