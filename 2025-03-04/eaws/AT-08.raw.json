Isolated danger zones occur at high altitudes esp. on shady ridgeline steep slopes, they can trigger small slab avalanches in steep shady terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. With rising temperatures and solar radiation, moist slides are increasingly possible."

The below-average old snowpack is well consolidated all in all. With rising temperatures and solar radiation, increasingly frequent gliding snow activity is expected."
