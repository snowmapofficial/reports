Moist loose snow avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes at elevated altitudes, in isolated cases also adjacent to ridgelines, as well as at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can be released in the old snowpack and reach medium size. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m, especially at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example."
