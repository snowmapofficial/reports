Isolated medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered even by minor additional loading. Avalanche prone locations are found on steep northwest to north to southeast facing slopes adjacent to ridgelines as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and size increase with ascending altitude. Small glide-snow avalanches can also trigger naturally on very steep intermediate altitude slopes with smooth ground, in all places with sufficient snow.",
