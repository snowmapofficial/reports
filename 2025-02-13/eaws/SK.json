Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in positions above the forest zone - on very steep slopes on which new snow is deposited. This locally forms snow slabs and pillows.",

        "comment": "In total, 5 to 10 cm of new snow fell on the mountains during the two days of light snowfall. This is being transported to the leeward slopes, under saddles and rock walls at high altitudes. In these places, the height of new snow is more than 20 cm, but this is a local matter. The new snow will not significantly change the snow conditions or the avalanche situation. The snow cover is well below average for this time of year. Continuous snow cover (together with older snow) is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above about 1500 m). On the surface there is on average 5 to 10 cm of new snow under which is mostly frozen firn, on the northern slopes crust. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice covered with newer snow."
