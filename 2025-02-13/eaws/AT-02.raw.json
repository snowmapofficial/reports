These drifts can be triggered in many cases by one sole skier, the releases will be small. In addition, isolated avalanches can trigger in the weak old snow, esp. on W/N/E facing slopes above 2200m. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. Avalanches can in isolated cases grow to medium size. Attention must be given to the dangers of being swept along and forced to take a fall."
