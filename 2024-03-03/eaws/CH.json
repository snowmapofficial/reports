A widespread compact layer of snow from the repeated snowfall last week lies beneath the large amount of fresh snow that has fallen in recent days. In the northern regions, the strong southerly foehn wind displaced a lot of loose snow and some large wind slabs that are prone to triggering have formed.</p><p>The old snowpack is compact in many places under the layers of new snow and snowdrift from the last week. However, it also contains various crusts and, between them, layers with a faceted crystal structure, in which avalanches have been repeatedly released by people in recent days, especially in the inneralpine regions.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes. These may be large in isolated cases in the north and more often in the south.</p>"
