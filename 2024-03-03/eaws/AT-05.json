Above that altitude the drifts on shady slopes lie deposited atop loose surfaces which can be weak layers. On W/N/E facing slopes there are faceted layers near melt-freeze crusts which are trigger-prone in isolated cases. At low and intermediate altitudes the snowpack is already thoroughly wet down to the ground. Hardly any longwave outgoing radiation during the cloudy night. Warmth in the daytime will further weaken the snowpack."
