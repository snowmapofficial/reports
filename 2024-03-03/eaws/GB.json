Winds, mainly South-Easterly fresh at first then strengthening during the day.\nObserved Weather Influences: Overnight and early this morning further snow showers fell mostly above 450 metres. Winds were generally light and the freezing level was around 700 metres. Brighter conditions arrived mid afternoon.\nObservedSnowStability: The new snow amounts are generally unconsolidated and often lying on bare ground. However, new windslab has developed mainly on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Localised instabilities in older windslab accumulations still persist. Areas most affected are North-West through North to East aspects above 850 metres, particularly in wind sheltered steep summit gullies and coire rims. Some Westerly aspects also affected due to cross loading.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
