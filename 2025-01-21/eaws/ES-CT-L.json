They are to be found in particular near the border with Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released in isolated cases by people. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in the vicinity of peaks. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As the moisture increases gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible below approximately 2200 m.",

In particular above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
