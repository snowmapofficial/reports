        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. Locally, weak layers in the old snowpack can be problematic. Small slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated cases by large additional loading, which happens more likely in places with little snow. Avalanche prone locations occur in extremely steep ridgeline terrain in W/N/E aspects as well as at entries into gullies and bowls. Dangers of being swept away and of taking a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses.",

        "comment": "The snowpack is stable by and large. At high altitudes, foehn winds have generated shallow snowdrifts on north-facing slopes. In addition, trigger-sensitive intermediate layers in the uppermost part of the snowpack have persisted. Fracture propagation is unlikely. On south-facing slopes there is little snow on the ground, mostly encrusted in the morning hours before softening up later on. In wind-exposed terrain the surface is wind-pressed, on shady slopes with little wind there is still loosely-packed snow. All in all, there is little snow on the ground."
