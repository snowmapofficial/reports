Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. <br/> Shady slopes: The no longer entirely fresh wind slabs are in individual cases still prone to triggering. The snowpack consists of faceted crystals, especially in places that are protected from the wind. Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist deeper in the old snowpack. <br/> Steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface. On sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying."
