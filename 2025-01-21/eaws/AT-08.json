However, the danger zones are easy to recognize for the practiced eye, thus, should be circumvented. In high-alpine regions the danger zones occur more frequently and the risks are greater. On steep shady slopes at high altitudes where the snow is shallow and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, slab avalanches can be triggered. A cautious route selection is imperative. At lower altitudes, isolated small avalanches are possibly triggered in extremely steep terrain. Naturally triggered small loose-snow avalanches are possible on extremely steep sunny slopes.",
