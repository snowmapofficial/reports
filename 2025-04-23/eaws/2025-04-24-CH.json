In the south, snowdrift accumulations are developing during the daytime with the northerly winds, and more wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected in these areas with sunshine.</p><p>In the south and west, the large amounts of fresh snow from the past week have largely stabilised. Only very occasional avalanches can still be triggered in the old snowpack, but these can become very large.</p><p>Although no human-triggered dry avalanches have been reported in the inneralpine regions of Grisons for some time, the snowpack still contains weak layers. When the snowpack initially becomes moist, these layers lose strength and fractures in the old snowpack become possible again. This currently mainly affects northern slopes between around 2400 and 2800 m.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m.
