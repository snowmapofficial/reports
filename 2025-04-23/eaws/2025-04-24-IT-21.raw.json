As a consequence of new snow and northwesterly wind, sometimes deep wind slabs will form in particular in places that are protected from the wind. These can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes and in gullies and bowls above approximately 2600 m. The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist and wet avalanches being released will increase a little in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2200 m."
