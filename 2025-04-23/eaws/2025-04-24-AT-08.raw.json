      "comment" : "Avalanche danger will rise to modearte above 2200m due to fresh snowfall and wind. Small-area snowdrifts are increasingly prone to triggering with ascending altitude. Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. In zones where there has been rain impact, small wet-snow avalanches are possible on steep slopes which have not yet discharged. In isolated cases, also small glide-snow avalanches are possible. Particularly in the Silvertta above 2600m, small to medium-siozed avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts by large additional loading. Such danger zones lie in little-tracked, shady backcountry terrain and are difficult to recognize."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "During mild nights of clear skies, the snowpack can freeze only slightly and in some places form a melt-freeze crust capable of bearing loads. At high altitudes, 10-25cm of fresh snow is anticipated. Due to intermittently moderate-strength westerly winds, small snowdrift accumulations will be  generated afresh. In zones with rain impact, the already thoroughly wet snowpack will be weakened another notch. Particularly in the Silvretta at high altitudes on very steep shady slopes, unfavorable intermediate layers are evident inside the snowpack."
