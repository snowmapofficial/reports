As a consequence of new snow and northwesterly wind, sometimes deep wind slabs will form in particular in places that are protected from the wind. These can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes and in gullies and bowls above approximately 2600 m. The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist and wet avalanches being released will increase a little in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2200 m.",

The sleet gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack above approximately 2200 m. The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already be soft in the early morning. <br/> Below approximately 1900 m hardly any snow is lying."
