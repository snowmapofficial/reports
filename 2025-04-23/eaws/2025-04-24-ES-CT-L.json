        "comment": "In all aspects mostly small moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. In isolated cases the avalanches in these regions are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information about the snowpack, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and wet snow require caution. Especially in the valleys bordering the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and the Pallaresa basin the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent."
