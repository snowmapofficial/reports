These meteorological conditions will cause a rise in the danger of wet and gliding avalanches below approximately 2800 m. They can be released naturally. This applies in particular in case of releases originating from starting zones that still retain some snow. <br/> In addition the wind slabs especially above approximately 2800 m are capable of being triggered in some cases still. Single snow sport participants can release avalanches in isolated cases, including medium-sized ones. This applies in particular on very steep slopes adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas.",
