Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on west, north and east facing slopes below approximately 2800 m. <br/> Up to high altitudes rain will fall from late morning over a wide area. As a consequence of the rain, the likelihood of wet avalanches during the day being released will increase. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> The wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases in particular on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/>"

      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already be soft in the early morning. The high humditiy will give rise to softening of the snowpack. This applies on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m, as well as on sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m. <br/> The rain will give rise as the day progresses to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack below approximately 2400 m. The snowpack will become wet all the way through. This situation will give rise to a loss of strength within the snowpack in particular on steep slopes. <br/> On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is lying. <br/> Somewhat older wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions."
