This applies in particular on very steep slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones, caution is to be exercised in steep rocky terrain, as well as on sunny slopes between approximately 2200 and 2800 m. <br/> Below approximately 2600 m mostly small moist loose snow avalanches are possible. <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the high Alpine regions, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
