      "highlights" : "Slight increase in danger of moist and wet avalanches as a consequence of solar radiation.",
      "comment" : "Towards its surface, the snowpack is largely stable and its surface has a crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> The early morning will see favourable conditions, but the danger of wet avalanches will increase later. <br/> Even a small avalanche can sweep snow sport participants along and give rise to falls, in the event of solar radiation caution is to be exercised on very steep slopes. <br/> Backcountry tours should be started early and concluded timely."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "In some regions in some localities up to 10 cm of snow will fall above approximately 2400 m. <br/> The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust only at high altitudes and will soften quickly. <br/> Below approximately 2000 m hardly any snow is lying."
