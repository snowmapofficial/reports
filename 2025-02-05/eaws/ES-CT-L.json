        "comment": "Until the early morning a generally favourable avalanche situation will prevail. Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in isolated cases in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered north and east facing slopes. In isolated cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized and in isolated cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and in the vicinity of peaks. In particular extremely steep shady slopes in places that are protected from the wind: In addition an appreciable danger of dry snow slides exists. These are rather small but in some cases easily released. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: As the day progresses small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are possible. They can to an increasing extent be released easily or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
        "highlights": "Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack necessitate caution. The danger of moist avalanches will increase during the day."
