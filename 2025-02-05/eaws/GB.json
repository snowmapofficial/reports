Strong winds, West-South-West or West.\nObservedSnowStability: New shallow windslab has developed around sheltered areas on North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. These areas are generally isolated, with gully exits and corrie rims most affected. Otherwise the snowpack is firm and well bonded at all levels. Cover is broken but generally improves with height.
