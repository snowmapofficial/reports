Danger zones occur mostly in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, and on very steep shady slopes. Danger zones and likelihood of triggering tend to increase with ascending altitude. Isolated whumpf noises can indicate imminent danger. On extremely steep sunny slopes, small wet-slides are possible as a result of the daytime warming and solar radiation."
