      "comment" : "The weather during Thursday will be influenced by an advancing cold front. During the day, we expect increasing cloud cover and light precipitation, but this will not significantly change the avalanche situation in the Slovak mountains. Due to the change in temperatures, the snow cover is settled and well consolidated. Avalanches can be released only sporadically, mainly on the northern slopes of the High and Western Tatras. Large additional loads are needed on steep and very steep slopes. In such a case a small avalanche or avalanche can be expected. The danger is rather due to lack of snow, protruding rocks and rock thresholds, or a small avalanche into exposed terrain.",
      "highlights" : "Predominantly favourable avalanche situation."

      "comment" : "Snow cover is below average for the time of year. Up to 1500m above sea level it is strongly local and oriented mainly to northern and shady places. The surface is mainly firn snow or crust. Due to rain and subsequent cooling, the surface is mainly hard and icy. Due to the expected cooling and increasing cloud cover, the snow cover is not expected to soften during the day. In the valleys, beware of icy conditions."
