Danger zones tend to increase in frequency with ascending altitude. Activities in backcountry demand cautious route selection, particularly in shady steep terrain seldom skied on. In isolated cases small glide-snow avalanches are possible. Caution urged below glide cracks. Due to daytime warming and solar radiation, increasingly frequent loose-snow slides are possible, particularly on steep sunny slopes."

Highly diverse snowpack surface are evident, there is still powder on shady wind-protected slopes, otherwise wind crusts. On steep sunny slopes a melt-freeze crust is evident. Encrusted snowpack surfaces moisten during the day."

On very steep grass-covered slopes, small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally."
