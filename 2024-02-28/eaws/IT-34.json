        "comment": "Natural avalanches are possible, even large ones, especially in steep rocky terrain, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above the tree line. In steep gullies in the regions with a lot of snow the avalanches can reach low altitudes. Even single backcountry tourers can release avalanches easily. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain in particular at high altitude. The avalanche prone locations are prevalent and are difficult to recognise. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection.",
        "highlights": "New snow and wind slabs represent the main danger. Backcountry touring calls for a certain restraint."

        "comment": "Over a wide area 10 to 100 cm of snow has fallen since yesterday above approximately 2000 m. The moderate wind has transported some snow. The large quantity of fresh snow as well as the wind slabs are very prone to triggering in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes. The snowpack will be in most cases moist. The high humditiy will give rise as the day progresses to thorough wetting of the snowpack over a wide area."
