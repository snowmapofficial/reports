The rain will give rise to rapid and thorough wetting of the old snowpack below approximately 1800 m. A lot of new snow above approximately 1800 m. The new snow and wind slabs of Thursday are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack in all aspects above approximately 1800 m. On steep slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls the avalanche danger will increase during the day to level 2 (moderate)."
