        "Summary": "SC 28.2.24 Isolated accumulations developing on N to E aspects above 900m. Firm elsewhere. Avalanche hazard Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Very hard snow ice on exposed windward slopes. Cloud base was at 700 metres all day. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous.",
        "Comment": "Thaw conditions overnight. New snow during the day.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight the freezing level will be above the summits with rain at all levels. By dawn the freezing level will be around 600 metres with light snow showers during the day.  Gale force winds from the South-West throughout the period.",
        "SnowStability": "After overnight thaw conditions, older snow is expected to become firmer, particularly at higher levels.  New windslab accumulations that develop over older snow-ice will be isolated and generally inconsequential. These deposits will be found in wind sheltered features such as corrie rims and gully tops on North to East facing aspects above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A cloudy but generally dry day. The freezing level was around 900 metres for most of the period. Strong winds from the South-West throughout.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Overall, the snow cover is thawing and diminishing in extent but localised areas of windslab persist, mainly on North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Steep, wind sheltered features such as corrie rims and gully tops are most affected. High exposed areas are still very firm and icy. Any remaining cornices are unstable. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

New accumulations of weakly bonded windslab will begin to accumulate on all steep North to East aspects above 900 metres during the morning. Stability will decline progressively in these locations over the course of the day, becoming poor later. New weak cornice development anticipated over steeper lee slopes. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

Some localised wet snow instability late in the period on steep North to East aspects above 950 metres.

        "SnowStability": "The old snowpack will continue to consolidate during Wednesday evening. Fresh deposits of unstable windslab will build through the remainder of the period, especially in the afternoon, on mainly North to East aspects above 850 metres.

Some significant cornices remain and are prone to collapse in the mild conditions. Stability on other aspects tends to be better. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "SnowStability": "Fresh accumulations of poorly bonded windslab will develop on North to East aspects above 1000 metres as the day progresses. Areas most affected will be steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims, gully tops and convexities where accumulations gain the greatest depth. Elsewhere, the moist snowpack will become firm with localised shallow accumulations of windblown snow at lower elevations. Cornices will be prone to collapse as temperatures fluctuate. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Some light snow showers were followed by a mainly dry day. Gale force winds were from the West overnight, before backing to become storm force Southerlies by dawn. The freezing level rose from 1000 metres at midday, to reside above the summits by the end of the period.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Poorly bonded windslab was deposited on North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Further localised deposits are present on North-West aspects due to cross loading. The greatest instability remains in accumulations which contain a low density layer above firm snow at depth. Areas exposed to the wind have been scoured, leaving bare ground and firm older snow patches. Below 1000 metres the snow is stable, firm and features a widespread crust. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
