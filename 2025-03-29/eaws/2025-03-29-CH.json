In Ticino, the weak layers in the old snowpack are now so heavily covered that only isolated avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up into high Alpine regions, as well as on western and eastern slopes below approximately 2000 to 2200 m.
