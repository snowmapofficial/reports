In addition, isolated small-to-medium wet slab avalanches are possible at the foot of rock walls. Runout zones of wet-snow avalanches should be avoided. Naturally triggered wet-snow avalanches will decrease as rainfall comes to an end. Above 1700m, fresh fallen snow and drifts are prone to triggering, one sole skier can trigger avalanches esp. in gullies and bowls in the zones which are much wind-impacted. Avalanches can in isolated cases fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and then lengtrhen the runout zones. Due to solar radiation, increasingly frequent loose-snow avalanches can be expected during the course of the day, mostly small-sized releases in case of extensive bright intervals.\nNaturally triggered small-to-medium wet avalanches will increase as rainfall sets in. On extremely steep slopes, small-to-medium wet loose-snow avalanches can be expected. Particularly at the foot of rock walls, small-to-medium wet slab avalanches are possible. Runout zones of wet-snow avalanches should be avoided. Above 1900m: lots of fresh snow expected which will be prone to triggering, also the freshly generated snowdrift accumulations, esp. in gullies and bowls in zones with wind impact. Avalanches can in isolated cases sweep along the thoroughly wet snowpack, which then lengthens the runout zone of the plummeting snow masses.",

Even one sole skier can trigger avalanches. Danger zones occur esp. on W/N/E-facing slopes above 2200m. Very isolated danger zones occur also on south-facing slopes above 2600m. In isolated cases, avalanches can sweep along more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack. Danger zones and likelihood of triggering will increase during the course of the day.",
