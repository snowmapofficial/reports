Avalanches can fracture in weak layers and grow to large size. Due to solar radiation in afternoon hours, naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches can be expected. Avalanches released at higher altitudes can fracture down to deeper layers and then plummet down to green zones.

Inside the snowdrifts, in addition, trigger-sensitive layers can form rapidly. Below 2000m the snowpack will forfeit its firmness and a crust will form on the surface."
