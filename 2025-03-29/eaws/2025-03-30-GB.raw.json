        "Summary": "CM 30/03 Isolated windslab instabilities on N through E to SE aspects above 950m. The Avalanche Hazard will be Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow throughout except on the highest tops. Poor visibility, summits remained in cloud all day. Winds gusting 45-50 mph.",
        "Comment": "A very wet day! Precipitation only falling as sleety snow on the highest tops. The ground is saturated under a damp snow cover at most levels. A ridge of high pressure will build from the West through Sunday bringing increasingly drier and brighter weather.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Storm force Westerly winds will ease by morning, veering North-Westerly. Light precipitation forecast this evening only falling as sleety snow on the highest summits. The freezing level is expected to be around 1000 meters overnight then gradually rising above the summits later in the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight isolated, windslab instabilities will remain on North through East to South-East aspects above 950 meters.  Areas mainly affected will be corrie rims and gully tops. These instabilities are expected to stabilise during the day. Elsewhere the snowpack will continue to consolidate and be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Gale force South-Westerly winds. Constant precipitation falling as sleety snow only on the highest tops. The freezing level rose to around summit level.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Isolated pockets of fresh windslab were present on North through East to South-East aspects above 950 meters. Areas most affected are gully tops and corrie rims. Fragile cornices  were also noted on the same aspects. Below 950 meters and on other aspects the snowpack is shallow, consolidating and generally stable. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "High pressure beginning to develop during Sunday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers are expected to clear during the night followed by a mostly dry day with the potential for a flurry of snow. Storm force Westerly winds will gradually ease through the day to become fresh North-Westerly by the end of the day. The fluctuating freezing level will rise from 1000 metres to above the summits during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will begin to consolidate in the fluctuating temperatures. Isolated instabilities will remain on North through East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres. Areas most affected will be steep, wind sheltered locations such as the tops of gullies, coire rims, ridge flanks and convexities. Elsewhere the old sparse snowpack will remain firm and stable.

        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, a short period of snow then some precipitation will turn to rain at most levels. The freezing level will steadily rise to be above the summits by mid morning. Drier by dawn staying dry for the rest of the day. The strong Westerly winds will ease becoming North-Westerly.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will start to thaw at all levels as the freezing level rises above the summits. Snow cover will diminish at lower levels quite quickly. Wet snow instabilities will be present where deeper snow accumulations persist, mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Tops of wind sheltered gullies, scarp slopes and steep coire rims mostly affected. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Last night and through most of today new accumulations of snow were generally shallow and stable. In wind sheltered locations some isolated areas of windslab was building. Areas mostly affected are tops gullies and steep scarp slopes on North to East facing aspects above 900 metres. Some small cornices were also forming above similar aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
