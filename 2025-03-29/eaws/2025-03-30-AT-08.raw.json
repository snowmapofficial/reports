One sole skier can trigger and small-to-medium sized slab avalanche in these zones. Wind-loaded steep terrain should be evaluated with caution. Small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible. Due to daytime warming and solar radiatio, increasingly frequent loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on sunny slopes in steep rocky terrain."

The snowdrifts which were generated by northerly winds have been deposited atop soft layers and are prone to triggering. On shady slopes at high and high alpine altitudes the near-surface and often faceted intermediate layers are prone to triggering. The snowpack is thoroughly wet up to high altitudes. Gliding movements over smooth ground continue to be possible."
