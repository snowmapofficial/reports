        "comment": "As a consequence of a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, precarious wind slabs formed at intermediate and high altitudes. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Some occasionally large avalanches are further not ruled out. These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects above approximately 1900 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. As a consequence of the wind the wind slabs will increase in size moderately until Monday. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase. These can be released very easily or triggered naturally. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur.",
