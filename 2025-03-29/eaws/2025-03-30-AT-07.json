        "comment": "Fresh wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can still be released in isolated cases by individual winter sport participants. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes above approximately 2200 m and on steep, little used west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size.",
