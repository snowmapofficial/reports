This applies especially in the regions exposed to precipitation in particular at intermediate and high altitudes, as well as on very steep slopes. <br/> Avalanches can in very isolated cases be released in the old snowpack. This applies in particular in case of a large load. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted and weak. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes. <br/> In particular in the vicinity of peaks snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all altitude zones only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."

In shady places that are protected from the wind: Towards its surface, the snowpack is dry and has a loosely bonded surface. <br/> In all aspects only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year.
