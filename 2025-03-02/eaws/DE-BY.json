        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low. In isolated cases snowdrifts can be problematic and can even be triggered by minimum additional loading as mostly small slabs. Avalanche prone locations occur in steep north-facing ridgeline terrain at high altitude. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. In addition, small loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep sun-drenched terrain. Furthermore, small spontaneous releases of glide-snow avalanches can occur on very steep slopes with smooth ground.",

On the sunny side the bonding with the encrusted old snowpack surface is good. However, up beyond the timberline there is no old snow base. Solar radiation will dissolve the bonding with the surface snow. The old snowpack as such is stable, at intermediate altitude thoroughly moist and increasingly wet down to the ground."
