        "Summary": "Low hazard. Minor full depth avalanches possible on Post Face and weakening cornices.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Crust at most levels.  Good visibility  Winds 20 -30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts",
        "Comment": "Old cornice debris is present on selected crag aprons and in some gullies.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild and wet for a time overnight then dry and cooler with the freezing level falling to just below summit level.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will become wet or moist for a time but remain generally well bonded. Some potential for minor full depth avalanches from the steep crags in Coire Ardair during and immediately after mild wet conditions. All cornices will weaken with the onset of mild temperatures and rain.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Dry throughout. Cold overnight then freezing just above summits during the day. Light to moderate, cold feeling South Westerly airflow.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded in all locations. A surface crust is present in many places. Large cornices remain over many very steep North to South East aspects. Older and more recent cornice debris is present on selected crag aprons and some gullies.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Areas of firm snow - ice on most aspects mainly above 1000m.  Clear, sunny conditions.  Winds approx 60-75 mph.",
        "Comment": "Firm snow with serious run out potential on steep slopes.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It is expected to be mostly dry apart from a spell of light rain and sleet during the night. Storm force West-South-Westerly winds will ease to gale force. Inversion conditions with the freezing level fluctuating around summit levels, later falling to around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will remain generally well bonded and stable throughout. The greatest cover will be above 1000 metres, around coire back walls, gullies and ridge flanks. The isolated accumulations of wind drifted snow on North to East aspects above 1000 metres will begin to thaw and consolidate. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Isolated accumulations of wind drifted snow are present on North to East aspects above 1000 metres, these continue to consolidate and are generally shallow and avoidable.

        "Comment": "Although the hills look white at higher levels the snowpack is shallow, and much of it will soon be gone when it turns mild and damp on Tuesday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "After a little overnight precipitation, which will fall as sleet on the highest summits, a dry windy day is expected. The freezing level will be around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The generally shallow snowpack will become damp overnight. Above about 1000 metres the surface will freeze later in the night and be crusty during the day. At lower levels it will slowly thaw and consolidate. In both cases stability will remain good.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Rain this evening, with likely summit sleet, will clear around midnight to give a largely dry and cloudy day, but with the slim chance of a light snow shower on the highest summits in the afternoon.
