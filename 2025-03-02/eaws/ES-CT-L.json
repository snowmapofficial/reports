        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate southeasterly wind, easily released wind slabs formed on Sunday in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at intermediate and high altitudes. Released avalanches and shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate this situation. On Monday they will increase in size additionally. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. As a consequence of the new snow more snow slides and avalanches are to be expected at any time, but they will be mostly small. These can in many cases be released easily or triggered naturally. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint. The fresh wind slabs are to be bypassed.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Dry and moist snow slides as the day progresses."
