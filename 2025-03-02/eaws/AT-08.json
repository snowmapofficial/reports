        "comment": "Predominantly favorable conditions prevail, with low avalanche danger. Isolated danger zones occur at high altitudes esp. on shady ridgeline steep slopes, they can trigger small slab avalanches in steep shady terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration. With rising temperatures and solar radiation, moist slides are increasingly possible.",
