Sometimes avalanches are medium-sized. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. Small and medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible as the moisture increases. This applies in particular on steep slopes above the tree line. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size."
