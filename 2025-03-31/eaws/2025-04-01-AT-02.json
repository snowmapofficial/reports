Even one sole skier can trigger avalanches, esp. above 2200m. Danger zones occur esp. on W/N/E-facing slopes above 2200m. Very isolated danger zones occur also on south-facing slopes above 2600m. In isolated cases, avalanches can sweep along more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack. Danger zones and likelihood of triggering will increase during the course of the day. In addition, avalanches can trigger and fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack, then grow to large size in isolated cases. Whumpf noises and glide cracks can indicate imminent danger. Remote triggerings and natural triggerings are possible. In the Glockner Massif and along the Salzburg border, danger zones are more frequent and larger. Loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. in case of extended bright intervals.",
