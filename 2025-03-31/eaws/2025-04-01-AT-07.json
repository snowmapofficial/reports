The new snow and wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the old snowpack especially on little used west, north and east facing slopes. This applies on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, as well as on west and east facing slopes above approximately 2600 m."
