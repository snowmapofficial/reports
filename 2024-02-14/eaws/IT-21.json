The fresh snow and in particular the sometimes deep wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant and generally at intermediate and high altitudes. These are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> In particular in the regions with a lot of snow more medium-sized and large moist and wet avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming. The wind slabs of the weekend will become increasingly prone to triggering in particular on steep sunny slopes.",
