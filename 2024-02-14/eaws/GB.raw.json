        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be mild with the freezing level around 1700 metres. There will be some rain later in the night and during the morning.",
        "SnowStability": "The rain will have a destabilising effect on the areas of moderately bonded windslab which will be found mainly, but not exclusively, on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Cornices will become prone to collapse as they become wet. Stability will start to slowly improve later in the day. Below 900 metres the snowpack will be wet throughout, more consolidated and stability will be better. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is slowly consolidating in the mild and settled conditions. Some relatively extensive areas of moderately bonded windslab remain. These are found mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Other aspects also hold pockets of windslab in wind sheltered locations. Some weak cornices remain.
