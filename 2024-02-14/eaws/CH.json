In addition, this week's mostly small wind slabs are sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>With temperatures warming up significantly, gliding avalanches are increasingly possible. This applies particularly to east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely to north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m.

Some avalanche-prone locations are still to be found, especially on shady slopes at a distance from ridgelines and protected from the wind. There, some near-surface layers of the snowpack are lying on angular layers in the area of the old snow surface. In addition, this week's mostly small wind slabs are sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>With temperatures warming up significantly, gliding avalanches are increasingly possible. This applies particularly to east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely to north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in some cases in regions with a lot of snow. In addition, moist snow slides and avalanches are possible on steep sunny slopes as the day progresses.</p>"
