        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small wet snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes. <br/> The wind slabs of the weekend can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. In many cases the avalanches are rather small and in isolated cases easily released. These avalanche prone locations are to be found on shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions.",

The wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack on shady slopes. <br/> The spring-like weather conditions from the early morning will give rise to rapid moistening of the snowpack on sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
