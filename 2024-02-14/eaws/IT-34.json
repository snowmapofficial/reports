        "comment": "The danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase during the day. Below approximately 2600 m small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible. The sometimes strong wind has transported some snow. The wind slabs have formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in the high Alpine regions. The fresh wind slabs can be released by small loads. The new snow of the last few days is very loosely bonded in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2000 m.",
