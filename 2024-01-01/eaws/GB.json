Showers are expected from midnight onwards, initially falling as snow above 700 metres then later above around 1000 metres. The freezing level will rise to around 1100 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: Winds were moderate increasing strong, generally South-Westerly. Light showers fell as snow above around 700 metres. The freezing level was around 750 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Fresh windslab is being deposited in sheltered areas, mainly on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. Accumulations are not extensive. Older moderately bonded windslab remains, mainly on West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. Unstable cornices are present above many aspects. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
