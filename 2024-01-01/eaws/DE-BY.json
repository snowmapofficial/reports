Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger.\r\nApart from that, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations can trigger a small slab even by minimum additional loading.

        "comment": "The old snowpack surface is icy, melt-freeze encrusted and capable of bearing loads. Only small amounts of fresh snow are being transported by westerly winds in exposed terrain, generating small, often trigger-sensitive drifts on leeward slopes. The old snowpack surface is stable but moist/wet down to the ground. Many glide cracks are evident. Due to persistent rainfall, water content at the snow base increases, thereby reinforced gliding snow. Backcountry tours usually require passages where skis must be carried."
