        "comment": "In the western part of the Low Tatras there is an increased avalanche danger, i.e. the 3rd degree above the upper boundary of the forest. Snowfall has hit the Low Tatras the hardest, about 30 cm of new snow has been gradually added to the hard old snow cover. The boundary of the snowfall was at an altitude of about 700 m above sea level. The passage of the front was accompanied by a very strong north-westerly wind. The main problems are therefore new snow and wind-blown snow (south-eastern and eastern exposures). The wind was mainly above the upper forest boundary. The leeward sides of ridges and steep couloirs of the highest elevations are dangerous, where the wind has deposited snow slabs and pillows and created cornices.",
