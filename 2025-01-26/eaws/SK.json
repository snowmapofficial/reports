        "comment": "Snow cover is well stabilized in most places in the morning. Snow will soften and lose stability as the day warms up. Avalanches and drifts of wet snow may occur on sunlit slopes and will be particularly dangerous on steep, exposed terrain. There is a risk of falling when hit by even a small avalanche or avalanche slide. Inflated snow pillows may occur sporadically at the highest altitudes of the High and Western Tatras, especially on shaded, steep to extremely steep slopes and couloirs. Their size and extent are small, with possible loosening under high additional loads.",

        "comment": "A significant inflow of warm air continues. The zero isotherm will be around 3000 m a.s.l. The snow is mostly well packed due to the change in temperature, but will lose cohesion as the day progresses due to warming. By early morning and early afternoon, the snow cover will still be hard in places and icy, with crusting. In the afternoon, on sunlit slopes, the snow will become saturated with water and scattered. Dry snow is only an occasional occurrence, especially on shaded steep high slopes and couloirs. Snow depths remain well below average for this time of year."
