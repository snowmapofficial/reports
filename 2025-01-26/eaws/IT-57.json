These can be released in near-ground layers in very isolated cases. In gullies and bowls individual small moist and wet avalanches are possible at intermediate altitudes.",

The older wind slabs are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. At intermediate altitudes a little snow is lying. These weather conditions gave rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack especially at intermediate altitudes."
