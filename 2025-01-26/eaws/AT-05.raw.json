      "comment" : "Avalanche danger above the treeline is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main danger stems from freshly generated snowdrift accumulations. Small slab avalanches can be triggered by one sole skiers in some places above the treeline. Danger zones occur also distant from ridgelines, near forest rims, behind protruberances and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls on W/N/E facing slopes. On shady steep slopes, fractures can in isolated cases penetrate down to more deeply embedded weak layers and the releases then grow to larger size. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deep snow."
