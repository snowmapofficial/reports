        "Comment": "Period of poorest stability expected overnight. Some early consolidation expected in all snow by the end of the day.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Less cold with a few overnight snow showers. Strong East-South-East winds overnight becoming light easing to light from the early hours onwards.",
        "SnowStability": "Forecasted snowfall in combination with redistributed snow will create new accumulations of weak windslab mainly on steep West to North aspects above 950m. Gully tops and coire rims the most affected areas. Residual instability in deeper older snow on steep North to East aspects above the same altitude. Period of poorest stability expected to be overnight and into the early hours. Early consolidation of snow expected on most aspects by the end of the day. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
