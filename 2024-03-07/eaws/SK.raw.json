Especially dangerous are western orientations, narrow chutes and places under rock walls. Locally there are wind-blown snow slabs and pillows. Loosening is possible on steep slopes, especially with high additional loads.\nBelow 2000 m avalanche danger is low. The snow cover here is generally well consolidated due to the low temperatures.",

At middle elevations, the water-soaked snow cover from the previous days is freezing due to the cooling and is stabilising significantly."
