        "SnowDistribution": "Variable conditions with a breakable crust on some higher slopes.  Mostly good visibility with long periods of sunshine, occasionally some low cloud over the summits. Winds 30-40 mph at higher levels, progress difficult and tiring during the gusts.",
        "Comment": "Inversion conditions; although the freezing level is above the summits the airmass over the mountains will remain cool.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry throughout the forecast period with strong East-South-East winds.  The 900 metre freezing level will steadily fall to around 600 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to consolidate at all altitudes and be generally well bonded and stable in most locations.  Some isolated instabilities will persist on very steep North-West to North-East aspects above 1100 metres. Cornices will overhang these aspects.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "Comment": "The snowpack will firm up. Correspondingly, the consequences of a slide or fall will be significant.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A mostly dry day is expected with the potential for very light trace snow above 500 metres early in the morning. Winds will be very strong and predominately from the East-South-East. Due to a temperature inversion, ground and snow temperatures are expected to be below freezing above 600 metres for the duration of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected. The snowpack will be firm and stable at all altitudes, and on all aspects. The greatest snow cover lies above 900 metres on North-West through North to Easterly aspects. Particularly in high coires and deeply defined gully lines. Large cornices remain. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

A firm snow surface exists above 1000 metres, while at lower elevations the snowpack is moist and subject to a slow thaw.

Areas most affected will be steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims, gully tops, coire head walls and crag aprons where deeper accumulations exist. Fresh unstable windslab will build on West to North aspects above 900 metres but these accumulations will be insignificant and easily avoidable. Elsewhere the snowpack will continue to consolidate.
