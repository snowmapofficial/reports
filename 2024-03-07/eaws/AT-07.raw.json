Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible. <br/> <br/> The new snow and wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized."

Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist in the top section of the old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes. This applies above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> Some snow will fall in some localities. The wind will be moderate to strong in some localities. Fresh wind slabs are lying on soft layers at elevated altitudes. The old snowpack will be moist below approximately 2200 m."
