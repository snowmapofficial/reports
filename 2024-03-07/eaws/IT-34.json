The new snow and wind slabs of Wednesday can be released easily in all aspects above the tree line. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. As a consequence of the rain, the likelihood of gliding avalanches and snow slides being released will increase on very steep slopes below approximately 1400 m.",
