        "comment": "Avalanche danger in the Bavarian Alps is moderate. Main problem: the snowdrift accumulations which in places can be triggered even by minimum additional loading (1 person). Danger zones occur on steep ridgelines slopes in NW/E/S aspects, they increase both in size and in frequency with ascending altitude. \r\nOn steep grass-covered slopes and in wooded zones in all aspects, glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally. Glide cracks are indicators of threatening danger. ",

The above-average snow depths have settled well and are stable. At intermediate and low altitudes the snowpack base is frequently wet; the result: it glides over the grassy slopes. "
