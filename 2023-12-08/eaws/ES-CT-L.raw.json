      "comment" : "The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in all aspects above approximately 2300 m. They are mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on near-ridge north, east and south facing slopes. <br/> In the evening as the snowfall level rises there will be a significant increase in the danger of moist avalanches. Numerous small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected."

      "comment" : "5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since yesterday above approximately 2000 m. The wind was moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines. <br/> Up to high altitudes rain will fall until Sunday. <br/> New snow and wind slabs are lying on a moist old snowpack. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
