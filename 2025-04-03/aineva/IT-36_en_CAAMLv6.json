In addition the easily released wind slabs must be taken into account. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes the avalanches can penetrate even deep layers. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> The avalanches can be released by small loads."

Precarious weak layers exist in the snowpack. <br/> Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good over a wide area. The upper section of the snowpack is hard and its surface has a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. In many places there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. The weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to thorough wetting of the snowpack."
