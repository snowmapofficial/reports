Small and medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible as the moisture increases. This applies in particular on steep slopes above the tree line. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size."

As a consequence of the solar radiation, the likelihood of avalanches being released will increase gradually in particular on steep grassy slopes in all altitude zones. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> The wind slabs of the last few days have bonded quite well with the old snowpack. These can in very isolated cases be released by people. Avalanches can in very isolated cases reach medium size. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places in particular on steep shady slopes. These avalanche prone locations are rather rare and are difficult to recognise. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes above approximately 1900 m. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach medium size. <br/>"
