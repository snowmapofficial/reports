The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, in particular on southwest, north and east facing slopes. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of wet avalanches being released will increase significantly. Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2800 m, as well as on very steep west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m. Avalanches can in some cases release the saturated snowpack. Gliding avalanches can also occur, in particular on grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can in isolated cases be released by small loads. Avalanches can in some cases be released in deep layers and reach medium size. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

This applies on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the snowpack over a wide area in all aspects below approximately 2600 m. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften earlier than the day before. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of foehn wind, wind slabs formed in the last few days especially adjacent to ridgelines. More recent wind slabs are lying on soft layers. This applies especially on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations at intermediate altitudes. Below the tree line a little snow is lying. <br/>"
