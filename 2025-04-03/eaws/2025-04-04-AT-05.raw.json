Slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading in some places. Esp. on W/N/E-facing slopes above 2200m, avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack and grow to large size. On extremely steep sunny slopes below 2600m, wet loose-snow and slab avalanches of medium size are possible, naturally triggered or person-triggered. On steep grass-covered slopes below 2400m, medium-sized glide-snow avalanches are possible."

In the lower and middle parts of the snowpack above 2200m there are weak layers of faceted crystals which are embedded between crusts. Below 2000m the entire snowpack is moist. Melt-freeze crusts and snowpack itself soften up during the day, the snowpack can forfeit its bonding thereby. Where the ground was bare of snow before the recent precipitation, the entire snowpack can slide away as a glide-snow avalanche."
