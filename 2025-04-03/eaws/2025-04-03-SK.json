During the last period of snowfall, the past two days, up to 20 cm of new snow fell locally. On the mountains above the forest belt, strong north to north-west winds are blowing, which are transporting this snow to the leeward slopes of southern orientations. Here, unstable snow slabs and pillows of varying thickness and hardness will form. Especially under saddles, rock walls, in moguls and steep couloirs. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads. Small avalanches can form in the afternoon on southern sunlit slopes, especially in steep rocky terrain.",
