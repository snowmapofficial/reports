Here, unstable snow slabs and pillows of varying thickness and hardness will form. Especially under saddles, rock walls, in moguls and steep couloirs. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads. During the day on sunlit slopes, splays or small avalanches can form, but especially in steep rocky terrain.",
