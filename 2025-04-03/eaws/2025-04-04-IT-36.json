In addition the easily released wind slabs must be taken into account. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes the avalanches can penetrate even deep layers. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> The avalanches can be released by small loads.",
