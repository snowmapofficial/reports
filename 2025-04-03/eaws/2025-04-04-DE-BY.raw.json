Snowdrift accumulations are the major problem, esp. on sunny, extremely steep slopes where slab avalanches can trigger naturally. Frequency of danger zones increases during the course of the day. Avalanches can grow to medium size. In some places, snowdrifts can trigger a slab avalanches by large additional loading.  Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, releases can reach medium size. On very steep grass-covered slopes and on very steep smooth ground, glide-snow avalanches can be expected, these can reach medium size in isolated cases."
