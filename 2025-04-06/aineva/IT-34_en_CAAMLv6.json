These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2800 m. Mostly the avalanches are small. Medium-sized avalanches are, however, further possible. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist loose snow slides being released will increase a little on extremely steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> The mostly small wind slabs of the last two days are in some cases prone to triggering especially on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m."
