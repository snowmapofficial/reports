Danger zones occur on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes which are difficult to recognize, they increase with ascending altitude. Backcountry tours require an well-considered route selection. Avalanche danger increases during the course of the day. Particularly in intensively sun-bathed steep terrain, increasingly also on shady slopes, small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalances remains difficult to assess."

The uppermost layers are often soft, but in early morning hours have formed a crust capable of bearing loads. The snowpack is throughly wet up to high altitudes but all-in-all well consolidated and stable. Due to daytime rise in temperatures and solar radiation, the snowpack weakens as the day unfolds."

Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. Due to daytime warming and solar radiation esp. on sun-bathed and rocky steep terrain, but also on shady slopes to an increasing degree, slides and mostly small-sized wet-snow avalanches are possible. Small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible."
