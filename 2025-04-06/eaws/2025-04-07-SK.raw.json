      "comment" : "In the high altitudes of the Western and High Tatras (above 1700 m above sea level) there is still an CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger level 3. The recent snowfall accompanied by strong north winds has created dangerous snow slabs and pillows of varying thickness. Their distribution is very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Often under saddles, rock walls and in leeward troughs, where new snow reaches more than 50 cm.  Avalanche release on steep slopes is possible with only a small additional load. Occasional spontaneous, medium-sized avalanches are possible.",
