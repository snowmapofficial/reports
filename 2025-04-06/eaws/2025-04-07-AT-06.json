There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can\u00b4t be ruled out. In few places fresh snowdrift deposits which formed with the northerly winds are prone to triggering, the risk of falling outweighs the risk of burial. In sunny rocky terrain loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can\u00b4t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces.",

        "comment": "Due to the cooling and temperature drop the snow cover can stabilize and build hoar on the surface due to the influence of the winds. In places thin snowdrift deposits are forming with the new snow which are poorly bonded with the old snow cover. Weak layers are only found in highest altitudes within the old snow cover (Graupel, soft crystals). The old snow cover is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."

From noon onwards, cumulus clouds will increase and the mountain peaks will be covered in fog. Apart from isolated snow showers, it will remain dry. The northwest wind remains brisk to strong, temperatures at 2.000 m are between -10 and -4 degrees, at 1.500 m between -8 and 0 degrees."
