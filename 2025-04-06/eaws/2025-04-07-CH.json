In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. A few avalanches have been triggered in the old snowpack in recent days, especially from the Davos region via the Engadine to Val M\u00fcstair, and occasionally also on the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais. With the northerly wind, small wind slabs formed locally at higher altitudes on Sunday.</p><p>With the warmth and sun, the snowpack is increasingly being saturated with water. On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2500 m. In areas with weak snow layering, moist slab avalanches can be triggered by people in some places.</p><p>A strong melt-freeze crust will form during the night into Monday. As daytime temperatures rise in the sunshine, this will soften as the day progresses and the risk of wet and gliding avalanches will increase.</p>"

The danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase during the day. Tours and hut ascents should be completed in good time.</p>"
