        "comment": "In the high altitudes of the Western and High Tatras (above 1700 m above sea level) the avalanche danger increases from 2nd to 3rd degree - CONSIDERABLE, due to snowfall and strong wind during the day. Snowfall accompanied by extremely strong northerly wind creates dangerous snow slabs and pillows of varying thickness. Their distribution is very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Often under saddles, rock walls and in leeward troughs, where new snow reaches more than 50 cm.  Avalanche release on steep slopes is possible with only a small additional load. Occasional spontaneous medium-sized avalanches are possible.",
        "highlights": "The danger is fresh, wind-drifted snow deposited in the form of wind slabs and pillows."
