In the morning temperature will be decreasing, that will stabilize the snow cover. Snow will start to fall in the afternoon. 10 - 15 cm of new snow will fall. The snow will be beaten down by the wind into slabs and pillows of varying hardness, which will be placed on a hard base, with the two layers weakly interconnected with each other. Due to the overall low snow cover, these may be mostly only small or medium avalanches.",

Movement off the beaten track is difficult. Cooling causes the snow surface to freeze and harden. This will increase its stability. Snow will start to fall in the afternoon. On average, there is between 20 and 50 cm of snow in our mountains. The continuous snow cover is mostly above the forest belt."
