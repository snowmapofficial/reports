The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2200 m and at transitions into gullies and bowls. <br/> At low altitude moist snow slides are possible."

      "comment" : "In some regions 5 cm of snow will fall until late in the night above approximately 2000 m. The wind will be moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines. The snowpack is favourably layered and its surface has a strong melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 80 cm of snow. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
