As a consequence of a strong to storm force wind from westerly directions, avalanche prone wind slabs will form in the course of the day in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, in particular on northwest to north to east facing aspects. Caution is to be exercised in particular on near-ridge slopes above approximately 2200 m. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are difficult to recognise. During the day: As a consequence of the sometimes strong westerly wind the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent. <br/> <br/> An increasing number of mostly small gliding avalanches are possible as a consequence of the new snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
