        "Comment": "Cold conditions will prevail tomorrow.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snowfall is expected throughout the period from glen level upwards. Winds will be very strong to gale force and generally North-Westerly. The freezing level will be at 400 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will become more widespread and deeper as the day progresses. Avalanches are likely on steep East though South to South-West aspects above 800m. Below 800m and above 400m, localised windslab will develop on steep banks. North and North-East aspects will be subject to localised windslab due to cross-loading. Coire rims, headwalls, gullies, and convexities will be most affected. Fragile cornices will continue to develop.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

These were mostly in wind sheltered areas such as coire rims, headwalls, gully tops and convexities. On all other aspects and elevations there is a deep covering of light new snow, which is unstable in steep locations above 800 metres. Elsewhere, the snow cover is thinner and lies on bare ground.
