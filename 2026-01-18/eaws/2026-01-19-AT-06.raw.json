What remains is the sometimes strong southerly wind, which will reach gale force at times, especially from the Eisenerz Alps to the Hochschwab. At an altitude of 2000 metres, it's between -4 degrees in the southern Niedere Tauern and -1 degree in the Ennstal Alps."

The danger areas are located in particular in the north-west to east aspects behind ridgelines and terrain edges as well as in the entrance areas to steep gullies and bowls. In particular, transitions from a little to a lot of snow and the edges of fresh and older snow packs should be avoided."

The risk of injury and falling generally outweighs the risk of burial. In general, be careful in the hardness or icy entrance areas to steep gullies.

In general, the snow cover is below average, with often only a few centimetres of snow covering the ground below the tree line."
