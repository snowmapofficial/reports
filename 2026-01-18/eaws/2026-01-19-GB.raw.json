        "Comment": "Icy conditions remain on some of the lower mountain paths.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snow fall during the evening above around 900 metres will clear to become dry and mostly sunny during the day. Continuing strong South-South-Easterly winds. The freezing level will rise above the summits during the day though much terrain will remain frozen above 600 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will be present on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gully exits and will be especially affected. Fragile cornices will overhang these aspects. Elsewhere the snowpack will be mostly well bonded and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fluctuating temperatures have helped improve the stability of the snowpack. However isolated accumulations of unstable windslab have developed on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. Also, lingering instabilities persist in the older windslab on the same aspects. Areas especially affected are steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gully exits. Fragile cornices overhang these aspects. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
