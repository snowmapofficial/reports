Many avalanches triggered by human activity, including those from the end of this week, show that the connection to the old surface of the snowpack is still weak. South of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, the entire snowpack is often faceted and loose. Here, avalanches may penetrate near-ground layers. On the northern flank of the Alps, in Valais and in northern Grisons, avalanches may still become dangerously large. Whumpfing sounds and remote triggering over larger distances have continued to be reported from Valais and northern Grisons in recent days. The probability of slab avalanches being triggered will decrease only slowly. The situation requires patience and caution.</p><p>With strong southerly winds at times, snowdrift accumulations that are prone to triggering have also formed in recent days.</p><p>The snow is wet at low and intermediate altitudes. Isolated gliding avalanches are possible on steep sunny slopes, especially on the northern flank of the Alps.</p>"
