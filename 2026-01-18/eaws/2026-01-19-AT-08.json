Danger zones are located expecially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers. In addition, as a result of foehn-wind impact, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been genearted particularly in ridgline and pass areas.",
