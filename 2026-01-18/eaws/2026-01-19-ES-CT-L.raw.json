Weakly bonded old snow on shady slopes.","comment":"The warm fresh snow and in particular the many sometimes large wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects at intermediate and high altitudes. These can be released easily and reach medium size. Dry avalanches can be released in the weakly bonded old snow also. Sometimes they are dangerously large. Shady slopes where weaknesses exist in the old snowpack are especially dangerous. At the border to Ribagorça and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience and great restraint."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Friday above approximately 1500 m. In particular above the tree line: The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. The new snow and wind slabs remain in some cases prone to triggering in particular on steep, little used shady slopes. Distinct weak layers exist in the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered west, north and east facing slopes. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 80 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Tuesday: Some snow will fall.
