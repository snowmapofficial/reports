The high-altitude wind is blowing brisk to strong and icy cold from south-east to south. Temperatures at 1500 metres above sea level from east to west between minus 2 and plus 3 degrees."

      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is low. In extremely steep shady slopes above the tree line, small slab avalanches cannot be completely ruled out. The risk of injury and falling generally outweighs the risk of burial. In general, be careful in the hardness or icy entrance areas to steep gullies. Especially in the extended northern exposures, fresh, thin snowdrift accumulations can cover the icy areas."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snow surface is crusted and hard, during the day it hardly softens even on the sunny slopes. The snow base, fundament is usually set and compact. In extremely steep shady-slope gullies, the snow base, fundament can be partially weakened by angular shapes, but these areas are rare. In general, the snow cover is below average, with often only a few centimetres of snow covering the ground below the tree line."
