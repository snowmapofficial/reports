Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Mostly avalanches are only small. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."
