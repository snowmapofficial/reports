        "comment": "Thursday: In some localities light snowfall to low altitudes. This applies in particular in the regions of the north exposed to the foehn wind as well as along the border with France and along the border with Switzerland. <br/> On Wednesday small wind slabs formed adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at high altitude. On Thursday these will increase in size additionally. These avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore barely recognisable. They can be released, even by a single winter sport participant, especially on very steep slopes. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> Loose snow avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases. This applies in particular on extremely steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "The weather will be cold. The fresh wind slabs represent the main danger."
