In the sectors from north-west to north to north-east, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by even a small additional load. Avalanches can break through to deeper weak layers and become medium sized if the snow is thick enough.\nSmall to medium-sized slab avalanches are also possible in fresh drift snow at a few danger spots, especially near the crest. Danger spots can be difficult to recognise in diffuse visibility.\nBelow 2800 m, small sliding snow avalanches can spontaneously occur.",
