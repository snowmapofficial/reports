Slab avalanches can be triggered in places on steep slopes at higher altitudes with low additional loads. On shady slopes at higher elevations, deeper layers can be disturbed and avalanches can reach medium size.\n\nWet snow becomes a problem below approx. 1800 m. On steep slopes interspersed with rocks, in very steep forest aisles and when exposed to sunlight, small, moist and wet loose snow avalanches are increasingly triggered spontaneously.\n\nOn very steep, smooth meadow slopes at all altitudes and exposures, smaller sliding snow avalanches can also detach themselves."

At higher altitudes, there are weak intermediate layers in the upper half metre of the snow cover in places. Under older accumulations of drifting snow, soft, fragile snow layers have been preserved in places. Only here is a break propagation over larger areas possible. Up to around 1800 metres, the snow becomes moist and loses its firmness with the onset of precipitation, mild temperatures and sunshine during the course of the day. The ground is not frozen and the snowpack base is often wet."
