Also sunny slopes high altitudes: <br/> Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds confirm this situation. In little used backcountry terrain the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Especially steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. Medium-sized avalanches are not ruled out.",
