Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can in isolated cases penetrate near-ground layers of the snowpack and reach quite a large size, in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, as well as in gullies and bowls. Steep, glaciated terrain must also be critically assessed. <br/> <br/> Only isolated gliding avalanches are possible. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"A little snow is lying.
