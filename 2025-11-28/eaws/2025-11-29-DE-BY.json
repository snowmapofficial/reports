On steep slopes interspersed with rocks, in very steep forest aisles and when exposed to sunlight, small, moist and wet loose snow avalanches are increasingly triggered spontaneously.\n\nOn very steep, smooth meadow slopes at all altitudes and exposures, smaller sliding snow avalanches can also detach themselves.",
