        "comment": "During the last snowfall period, 30 - 60 cm of new snow was added in our mountains, most of it in the Low Tatras and Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Fatra. The situation is gradually stabilising. The danger is concentrated in places where there are hard blown slabs. Smooth grassy slopes and very steep slopes above 35\u00b0 are particularly dangerous. There is still powder snow in the north and in shady locations. In the south, due to sunlight and positive temperatures, we can expect minor spontaneous avalanches. Below the upper forest line and at lower altitudes there is significantly less snow, so the situation is more stable there.",

It is between these two layers that there was a large difference in hardness and therefore an interface along which avalanches can be triggered. In the north, in shady locations and where there was less wind influence, the snow is powdery. The total snow depth in our mountains is 10-120 cm."
