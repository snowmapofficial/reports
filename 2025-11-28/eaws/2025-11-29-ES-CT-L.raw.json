Weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack can be released by people on shady slopes. Also sunny slopes high altitudes: <br/> Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds confirm this situation. In little used backcountry terrain the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Especially steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. Medium-sized avalanches are not ruled out."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted. Also sunny slopes high altitudes: <br/> <br/> On Saturday it will be sunny at times. <br/> In particular sunny slopes and low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. <br/> In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"As a consequence of falling temperatures, the activity of moist avalanches will gradually increase.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-11-29T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-11-30T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-11-29"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2100"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","N","E"]},{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{"lowerBound":"1800"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["SW","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"2ac239d0-e7e1-4d26-b0ed-33ed318a8719","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
