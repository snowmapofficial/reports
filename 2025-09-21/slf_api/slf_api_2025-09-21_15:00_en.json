The fresh snow and the wind slabs formed by the moderate to strong southerly wind are prone to triggering. Persons can release avalanches. In some cases these are medium-sized. The avalanches are otherwise rather small. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for careful route selection. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."}],"customData":{"CH":{"aggregation":[{"category":"dry","validTimePeriod":"all_day","problemTypes":["wind_slab"]}]}},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"<h1>Snowpack</h1><p>In September, snow repeatedly fell at higher elevations.
