        "Summary": "NC for 22.11. Avalanches likely overnight on steep NW,N,NE,E aspects above 900m.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow at all altitudes - very hard going on foot.  Winds approx 10 - 20 mph fresh, cooling. Generally good visibility.",
        "Comment": "A milder period through the night with instabilities and avalanche activity expected  in steep places. Snowpack consolidating and stabilising during the day as it cools.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Becoming milder through Friday evening. Winds strong to gale force SW to W overnight then easing to light Westerly during the day. Freezing level at summits overnight then cooler during the day as the freezing level lowers to around 900m. Precipitation falling as rain below summit  levels overnight with sleet and snow on summits. Then mainly dry through the day with occasional snow showers possible above 800m.",
        "SnowStability": "As the freezing level rises overnight a period of instability is expected, mainly on North-West through North to Easterly aspects above 900m, with gully tops, coire headwalls and coire rims most affected, here avalanches are likely. The snowpack will refreeze and stabilise in most areas as it cools during the day. Diminished snow cover at lower elevations becoming  firm and stable above 900m. Cornices remaining unstable on same aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A clear day at first with strengthening winds fresh West to South-Westerly with drifting snow. Dry in the morning with snow showers in the afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "A generally shallow and stable snow cover on all aspects and elevations above 600m. Deeper above 800m or so with unstable windslab present mostly above 900m on East through South to South-Westerly aspects. Redistributed snow, as the wind backed South-Westerly, has formed new unstable windslab on NW through N to E aspects above 950m. Wind sheltered steep places such as coire rims, gully tops and convex terrain most affected. The avalanche hazard is Considerable",
