        "comment": "In all altitudes of the Tatras and Low Tatras there is a SMALL avalanche danger in the morning, which increases in the high altitudes during the day to MODERATE - 2nd degree. On steep slopes it is possible to release an avalanche under load, but smaller spontaneous avalanches from new snow are also expected. More dangerous are places where there is older frozen snow under the new snow or in places with smoother surfaces - grass or rock slabs.",
