They will be deposited on soft layers especially on wind-protected shady slopes and at elevated altitudes. The dry avalanches are rather small. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. Backcountry touring calls for meticulous route selection.",

The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. For this reason snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. 5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until late morning. By the early morning the wind slabs will increase in size. On Saturday it will be sunny over a wide area."
