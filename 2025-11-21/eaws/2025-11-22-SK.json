        "comment": "Due to snowfall and winds of different directions, new snow is distributed irregularly, so in places where a larger amount is piled up, it is possible to release an avalanche. Occasionally, smaller spontaneous avalanches from new snow are possible. More dangerous are generally places where there is older frozen snow under the new snow or in places with a smoother surface - grass or rock slabs.",
