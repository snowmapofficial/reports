They will be deposited on soft layers especially on wind-protected shady slopes and at elevated altitudes. The dry avalanches are rather small. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. Backcountry touring calls for meticulous route selection."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Over a wide area 20 to 30 cm of snow fell in the last two days above approximately 1500 m. The weather was cold. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. For this reason snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. 5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until late morning. By the early morning the wind slabs will increase in size. On Saturday it will be sunny over a wide area."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Significant increase in danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides as the snowfall level rises.
