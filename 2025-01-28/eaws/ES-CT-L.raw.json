These can in some cases be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above approximately 2000 m. <br/> <br/> At low and intermediate altitudes the avalanche situation is generally favourable."

      "comment" : "Up to high altitudes rain fell on Monday in particular at the southern border of Aran. In particular in the south and in the southwest 5 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell during the night above approximately 1500 m. The southwesterly wind will transport the new snow. As a consequence of falling temperatures the snowpack consolidated during the night. <br/> <br/> In particular adjacent to ridgelines: Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
