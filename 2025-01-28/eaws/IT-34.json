As a consequence of a strong to storm force wind from southwesterly directions, deep wind slabs will form. The fresh wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on west to north to east facing aspects. They are lying on soft layers on shady slopes. This applies in particular at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. <br/> New snow is lying on a moist old snowpack. This applies below the tree line. <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
