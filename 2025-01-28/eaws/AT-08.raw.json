Danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude, particularly on steep shady slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Also naturally triggered avalanches reaching medium size are possible. Activities in backcountry demand experience in avalanche danger assessment. In isolated cases, small slab avalanches can be triggered on high-altitude extremely steep shady slopes also in the old snow, usually by large additional loading and where the snow is shall"

Amid intermittently strong westerly winds, the snow will be transported and fresh snowdrifts will accumulate. Fresh snow and drifts will bond poorly-to-moderately on steep shady slopes, atop a soft old snowpack. Snowdrifts from previous days will often be blanketed. The snowpack beneath them is generally well consolidated. At lower altitudes the fresh snowfall often lies deposited on bare ground."
