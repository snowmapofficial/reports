        "Summary": "TOR for 29/1 Snowpack stability will generally be good. Localised fresh windslab, steep SE to S aspects above 800m. Av Hazard Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack at lower levels, but good above 800 metres. Cloud base was at 550 metres most of the day. Winds persistent at 10-20mph.",
        "Comment": "Instabilities are expected to develop in fresh windslab due to a combination of wind redistribution and fresh snow. Little change expected over the following days, although becoming a little colder.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will largely be overcast with light wintry showers, fresh snow lying above 500 metres as the freezing level gradually lowers from 900 to 600 metres through the forecast period. There will be a persistent North to North-West wind throughout.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to consolidate and stability will generally be good. However, localised, largely shallow and avoidable areas of unstable windslab will continue to slowly develop mainly on steep wind sheltered South-East to South aspects above 800 metres. Wind exposed ridges and summits will remain scoured and icy in places.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A day of hill fog, cloud base persistent at 550 metres, with light rain and drizzle, wintry above 800 metres. Freezing level around 850 metres late morning and accompanied by a moderate Northerly wind.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is largely shallow, thawing below 850 metres, with generally good stability throughout. Deeper and more widespread accumulations are on North-East to South-East aspects mostly above 750 metres. Inconsequential deposits of fresh windslab noted in steep South to South-West aspects around summit levels. Wind exposed ridges and summits are scoured and icy in places.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected in the existing snowpack. Areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain on North-West through North to East aspects above 950 metres.

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack continues to slowly consolidate in the settled conditions. Some instabilities remain above 900 metres in deposits of windslab found on mainly North-West through North to East aspects. On other aspects the snowpack tends to be very shallow and stable.

        "Comment": "A slowly consolidating trend combined with new windslab development in the expected cold conditions.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow is anticipated throughout the forecast period. This will initially fall above 800 metres overnight, and 600 metres during daylight hours. Winds will be from the North-West strong, increasing to very strong later. The freezing level is expected to be at around 800 metres overnight, dropping to 450 metres later.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated areas of moderately bonded windslab will build on East to South aspects above 800 metres as the day progresses. Accumulations will be mostly limited and avoidable exhibiting weaknesses only where they achieve  depth in steep wind sheltered location such as coire rims and gully tops. Outwith these locations the snowpack will continue to slowly consolidate and become firm, aided by the presence of a widespread icy crust above 1000 metres.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Snow at higher elevations turned to rain at all levels by dawn. Winds were fresh and generally North-Westerly. The freezing level was around 1200 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Moderately bonded windslab remains on North-West through North to East aspects above 950 metres, while shallow isolated accumulations are also present on South-East and South aspects. The presence of an icy rain crust above 1000 metres aids stability. However, windslab in steep wind and rain sheltered locations, such as coire rims and gullies, still contains weaknesses at depth. At lower elevation the snowpack is moist and subject to slow consolidation. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
