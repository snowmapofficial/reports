Caution urged below glide cracks. Othewise low avalanche danger. Small, wet loose-snow avalanches are possible in extremely steep terrain. Isolated avalanche triggerings by winter sports enthusiasts possible in extremely steep shady terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate consideration.",
