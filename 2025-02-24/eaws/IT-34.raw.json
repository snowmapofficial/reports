The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on very steep north, east and west facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, as well as in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> Wind slabs can in very isolated cases be released, in particular by large loads. They are mostly small. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes. They are easy to recognise. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> As the penetration by moisture increases individual small wet loose snow avalanches are possible."

The surface of the snowpack will freeze very little. The snowpack will be moist at low and intermediate altitudes."
