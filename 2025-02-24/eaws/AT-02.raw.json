From the south, clouds will accumulate and the Karawanken and Carnic Alps summits will often be shrouded in clouds. From the SW, clouds will increase during the daytime hours. In the western mountain massifs, gray skies in the afternoon, from Nockberge to Koralm a bit of sunshine before dense cloud cover moves in from the west. Light to moderate SW winds. At 1000m: +5 degrees; 2000m: -1 degree, at 3000m: -7 degrees. Source: Geosphere Austria"

      "comment" : "Weak layers in the old snow can be triggered in very isolated cases on steep W/N/E facing slopes above 2300m. Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. These danger zones occur seldom. Avalanche releases tend to be small-sized. Due to the moistened snowpack, wet loose-snow avalanches are possible, but small, esp in extremely steep sunny terrain and avalanche starting zones which have not yet discharged."

      "comment" : "W/N/E facing slopes above 2300m:  the snowpack has faceted, expansively metamorphosed weak layers with a loose surface of surface hoar and faceted crystals. In the lower most part esp. on W/N/E facing slopes there are faceted expansively metamorphosed weak layer evident. South-facing slopes and terrain below 2000m: the snowpack is largely stable, a melt-freeze crust on the surface. Weather conditions are moistening the snowpack during the daytime hours.  Highly varied snowpack. There is too little snow on the ground for this juncture of the season."
