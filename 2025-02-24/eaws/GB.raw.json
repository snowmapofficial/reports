        "Comment": "The existing snowpack will remain firm and stable, and may present serious consequences in the event of an uncontrolled fall or slide.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers are expected throughout the period above 700 metres, although snow amounts are expected to be nothing more than a trace. Winds will be gale force South-Westerly overnight, veering West-South-Westerly later. The freezing level will be around 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will remain firm, well bonded and stable. Greatest extents will be found on North-West through North to East aspects, in locations such as coire headwalls and gully lines above 900 metres. Shallow accumulations of windslab will develop in very steep wind sheltered locations of a North to East aspect above 900 metres, these are expected to present as isolated and avoidable pockets overlying the existing firm snowpack. Bare ground will be icy. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Rain overnight turned to snow showers above 900 metres during the day. Winds were generally gale force and from the South-West. The freezing level was at 1000 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded and stable, with a firm surface above 900 metres. The greatest snow cover is found on North-West through North to East aspects, in locations such as coire headwalls and gully lines. A trace of new snow was noted above 900 metres, although accumulations are insignificant. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Fragile cornices will also continue to develop above similar aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "It was slightly cooler today and not as windy but the winds were still quite strong from a South-Westerly direction. Squally precipitation fell mostly as rain but at times a mixture of rain and hail, it also gave a very light dusting of new snow during the morning mainly above 950 metres. The freezing level fell during the course of the day to around 900 metres accompanied by further wintry snow showers mainly above 850 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The new snow accumulations are currently not deep or significant. But, some localised areas of shallow, poorly bonded windslab was starting to develop in wind sheltered locations. The greatest accumulations are on North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres with coire headwalls, scarp slopes and sheltered gullies being particularly affected. New fragile cornices were also developing above similar aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
