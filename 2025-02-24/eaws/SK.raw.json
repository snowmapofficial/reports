      "comment" : "In all mountains there is only a LOW avalanche danger (level 1). The situation is stable, the older snow cover is hardened. Up to 10 cm of new snow has fallen in the last two days, but it has fallen without significant wind influence. Mostly in the High Tatras. Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in positions above the forest zone - on very steep slopes.",

New snow has fallen mainly at high altitudes above 1 500 m above sea level. It is not cohesive with the hard ground. In the northern shady troughs and moguls locally dry powder snow up to 20 cm. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice covered with newer snow."
