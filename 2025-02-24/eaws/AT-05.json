        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2000m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Due to southerly foehn winds, shallow fresh snowdrift accumulations are being generated which can be triggered as small avalanches even be minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur esp. in very shady gullies and bowls distant from ridgelines. Heightened danger of taking a fall needs adequate consideration. Avalanches in the old snow are isolated, possible only in extremely steep terrain. Gliding snow activity is increasing below 2400m. Avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. Small loose-snow avalanches in extremely steep terrain are possible.",
