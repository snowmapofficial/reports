During the day the situation on sunlit slopes is slightly worsening, wet snow will be a problem. Avalanches are possible only on isolated very steep slopes, especially with high additional loads. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected except for wet avalanches.",

        "comment": "Due to the alternation of positive and negative temperatures, the snow cover at high altitudes has hardened and frozen. During the day, the snow on sunlit slopes softens and becomes wet. On northern and shaded slopes the snow cover is hard all day. Continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1200 m and reaches 50 to 80 cm at the highest altitudes.  In the Western and High Tatras the snow is from about 1500 m above sea level and mostly reaches only 50 cm."
