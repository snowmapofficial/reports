At high altitudes, slab avalanches can be triggered on steep slopes in northern exposures, especially with high additional loads. They usually remain small, but can occasionally reach medium size in wind-protected areas above 2200 metres. Above terrain traps, the risk of being swept away by small snow slabs must be taken into account.\n  \nIn addition, individual, small sliding snow avalanches can be triggered on extremely steep sunny slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged."

Under the snow cover, the accumulating transformation is progressing, especially on shady slopes. Above 2000 m, the upper half metre of the snow-covered surface has been preserved in many places. The base of the snowpack is partly wet. On the south side, the ground is increasingly pitting in the middle layers."
