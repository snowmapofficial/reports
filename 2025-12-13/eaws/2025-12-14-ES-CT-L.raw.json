They can be released by a single winter sport participant, but they will be small in most cases. <br/> <br/> A great many small and medium-sized gliding avalanches have been released last week. As the temperature drops there will be a gradual decrease in the danger of gliding avalanches. Individual small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: The old wind slabs are mostly small and can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Sunday: The weather will be mostly sunny. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> Intermediate and high altitudes shady slopes: Towards its surface, the snowpack is weak in some cases; its surface consists of faceted crystals. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Gradual increase in danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides as the penetration by moisture increases.
