        "Comment": "Heavy amounts rain is forecast to affect the area with nearly 60 millimeters rain expected to fall.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild, the freezing level above 2000 metres. Wet, heavy pulses of rain at all levels throughout the period accompanied by storm force South-South- Westerly winds these may ease early morning but still remain strong.",

        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Last night another dusting of new snow fell mainly above 1000 metres these accumulations are not significant. The approaching mild conditions will quickly thaw these new snow deposits and especially as rain started to affect the area before midday. The winds were South-Westerly fresh at first and increased to strong by midday. The freezing level was around 1100 metres this morning but was rising above all summits in the afternoon.",
