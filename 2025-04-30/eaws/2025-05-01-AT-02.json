Acute danger of falling on the hardened crusts in steep terrain. The snowpack is thoroughly wet, esp. on shady slopes below 2800m and on sunny slopes also in high-alpine terrain. In all regions, too little snow on the ground. Hohe Tauern: below 2200m hardly any snow. Carnic Alps: below 1800m, hardly any snow on the ground."
