The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to around 2800 m. Large wet avalanches may still occur at these altitudes because some weak layers deep in the snowpack will become significantly less stable when they first become saturated.</p><p>After a mostly clear night, the surface of the snowpack will be capable of bearing loads above around 2200 m early on Thursday morning. Over the course of the morning, it will soften rapidly in the sunshine and rising temperatures and the risk of wet avalanches will increase.</p>"
