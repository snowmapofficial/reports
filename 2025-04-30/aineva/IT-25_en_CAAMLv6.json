      "comment" : "More recent wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads, on very steep shady slopes above approximately 3000 m. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2800 m hardly any more medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large moist and wet avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a rapid increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow."

      "comment" : "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by quite favourable conditions generally, but the danger of wet avalanches will increase later. The sleet gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2600 m. Relatively hard layers of snow are lying on a moist old snowpack."
