On slopes with sufficient snow in extremely steep terrain, wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally or be triggered by persons in very steep terrain. Loose-snow avalanches are mostly small-sized. In addition, wet glide-snow avalanches are possible on smooth ground as well on meadows or rock slabs at anytime. Isolated glide snow avalanches can grow to large size."

In general the snowpack is moist to wet up to high altitudes. Pronounced layers within the snowpack are now only found on shady sides. South-facing slopes are widespread bare. In some places above approx. 1500m there is still a cohesive snow cover on the shady side."
