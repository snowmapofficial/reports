        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and wind from southerly directions, wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at elevated altitudes. They are to be found in particular on northwest, north and east facing slopes. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized and can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Southern border of Aran: <br/> Here the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Large avalanches are still not ruled out. <br/> <br/> Especially on steep sunny slopes and at low and intermediate altitudes individual small and medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and wet snow require caution. Especially in the valleys bordering the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and the Pallaresa basin the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent."
