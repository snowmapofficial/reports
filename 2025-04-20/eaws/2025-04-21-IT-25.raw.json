      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and wind, large surface-area wind slabs formed in the last few days adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as above approximately 2600 m. They can be released easily in some places especially on very steep shady slopes. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m many wet slab avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. Dry and moist avalanches are possible, even quite large ones. <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a rapid increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow. The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring."

Especially high Alpine regions: As a consequence of the southeasterly wind the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. <br/> <br/> The sleet gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2600 m. New snow and wind slabs are lying on a moist old snowpack. <br/> Below approximately 2000 m only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
