        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 1600m is moderate. Main problem: wet snow. On slopes with sufficient snow in extremely steep terrain, wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally or be triggered by persons in very steep terrain. Loose-snow avalanches are mostly small-sized. In addition, wet glide-snow avalanches are possible on smooth ground as well on meadows or rock slabs at anytime. Isolated glide snow avalanches can grow to large size.",
