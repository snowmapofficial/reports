The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in extremely steep terrain. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate an unfavourable avalanche situation, caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. <br/> <br/> Fresh snow and large quantities of wind-drifted snow of the last few days are in some cases still prone to triggering. As a consequence of warming and solar radiation, the natural activity of small and medium dry and moist avalanches will gradually increase, in particular on rocky sunny slopes, as well as at the base of rock walls in particular below approximately 2900 m.",
