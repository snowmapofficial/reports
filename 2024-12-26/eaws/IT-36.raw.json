In addition the wind slabs at the base of rock walls are prone to triggering in many places. In some places the avalanches can be released easily. Avalanches can be released, even by a single winter sport participant. Meticulous route selection is appropriate. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."
