These can in some places be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude."

The moderate wind will transport the new snow significantly. The wind slabs are located on a brown crust due to the effect of Saharan dust."
