Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes above the tree line. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are difficult to recognise. <br/> <br/> Additionally in isolated cases avalanches can release deeper layers of the snowpack. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2200 m. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. In particular on steep grassy slopes mostly small gliding avalanches are possible."
