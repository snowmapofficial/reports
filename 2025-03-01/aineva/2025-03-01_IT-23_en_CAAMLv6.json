The small quantity of fresh snow of Tuesday and very particularly the wind slabs to be found above all in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain can be released by a single winter sport participant above approximately 2300 m. The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence, in particular on very steep shady slopes in little used backcountry terrain. This applies especially above approximately 2500 m along the border with France and along the border between Valais and Italy. Here the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger."
