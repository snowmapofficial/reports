        "WeatherInfluences": "It will remain dry with South-Westerly winds that will slowly increase overnight to become very strong during the day. The freezing level will be around 900 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Areas of unstable windslab will remain, mainly on North to East aspects above 1100 metres. Fragile cornices will be present above these aspects.
