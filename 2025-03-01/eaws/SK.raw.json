      "comment" : "Moderate avalanche danger (level 2) is declared in all mountains. Up to 30 cm of new snow has fallen in the last two days, mainly over the forest zone. It was blown by the wind over the eastern slopes, where it formed slabs and pillows. The new snow is poorly bonded to the old hard ground. In some places there are even weak layers of square-grained snow in the snow cover, especially on northern orientations. Due to the small amount of snow, we expect only small or medium avalanches. Smaller spontaneous avalanches may also occur.",

Mostly in the Low Tatras. The new snow is still powdery in the north. A crust has formed on the southern sides, which is cut when skiing. Especially on the northern sides of the mountains there is a layer of square-grained snow at the interface between old and new snow, which forms a potential avalanche weak layer."
