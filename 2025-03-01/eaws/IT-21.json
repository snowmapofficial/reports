        "comment": "5 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall from midday. As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate easterly wind, sometimes deep wind slabs will form in particular in gullies and bowls as well as at intermediate and high altitudes. <br/> At low altitude only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
