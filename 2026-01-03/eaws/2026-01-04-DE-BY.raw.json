The resulting fresh and somewhat older snowdrift accumulations often lie unfavourably on a melt-freeze crust, especially on the shady slopes. In the area of the melt-freeze crust, weak layers of built-up crystals can be found, especially at higher altitudes. Intermediate layers prone to triggering can also be found within the wind slab.
