The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> In particular on steep shady slopes the avalanches can be triggered in the old snow and reach large size in isolated cases. Even single winter sport participants can release avalanches in some places. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack.
