The avalanche danger is local, concentrated in places where the wind has accumulated a larger amount of new snow. Such locations are relatively easy to spot in the terrain. The new snow is deposited in the form of unstable snow slabs and pillows in gullies, moguls and under rock walls. Avalanche release on such steep slopes, where there is still old frozen snow under the new snow, is possible, especially with additional loads. Larger spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",

However, due to strong winds, it has been transported to leeward places and into the forest zone, where its height reaches more than 60 cm. In places exposed to the wind, the surface of the snow is blown down to the old snow or rocks and grass. Due to the very low temperatures, the new snow cannot bind with the old snow base and remains unstable. Underneath the new snow and the old hard crust there is a distinct layer of square-grained snow. This can be an avalanche problem at higher additional loads. Old frozen snow is found from about 1400-1700 m above sea level (depending on orientation and mountain range). The total snow depth remains below average, ranging from 25 to 75 cm.\nfk"
