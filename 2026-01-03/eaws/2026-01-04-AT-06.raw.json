      "comment" : "Dense clouds will gather from the south-east in the evening, and it may snow a little in places on Sunday night. However, there are no signs of any major amounts of new snow anywhere. On Sunday, residual clouds between the Koralpe and Wechsel will clear quickly in the morning and the sky over the mountains will be mostly cloudless during the day.\nIn the northern Alps, the temperature at 2000 metres above sea level will be between -14 and -11 degrees. Brisk winds with gusts of around 50 km/h from the west. Amounts of new snow of up to 10 cm are expected.\nIn the Wechsel area, the temperature at an altitude of 1500 metres will be between -10 and -7 degrees. Brisk winds with gusts of around 60 km/h from the west. The snowfall level is in the valleys. Amounts of new snow of up to 10 cm are expected.\nNo new fallen snow is expected in the Gurktal Alps."

    "avalancheActivity" : {
      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is currently low. Attention must be paid to fresh small-scale snowdrift accumulations above 2000 metres. These can be triggered by individuals as small slab avalanches, especially behind broad ridges and ridgelines in northern and eastern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are easily recognisable."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Between the Dachstein and the Totes Gebirge, 10 cm of new fallen snow has fallen in the last 24 hours. However, the stormy westerly winds continued to cause drifting, resulting in prone-to-triggering snowdrift accumulations. These often lie on angular shapes or on a hard old snowpack.\nOtherwise, the snowpack surface is hard or icy. In the shady slopes, the kinetic metamorphism weakens the snow layering.\nIn general, there is little snow in the terrain."
