        "comment": "The fresh and older wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep east, north and west facing slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. They are sometimes deep and in some cases prone to triggering. Weak layers deep in the old snowpack can be released in some places by people in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In many cases the dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> On steep grassy slopes more gliding avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m and on sunny slopes above approximately 2000 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
