The strong southerly winds and fresh snow on the Main Alpine Ridge and in the south are resulting in snowdrift accumulations that are prone to triggering. In the inneralpine regions of Grisons in particular, where there has been only little fresh snow, faceted weak layers in the old snowpack are still sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>The snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes upto around 2800 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to around 2400 m. Medium to large wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected, in the north mainly as the day progresses, but all day in the south with little outgoing longwave radiation and rain. In the regions in the Bernese Oberland and Valais which have experienced heavy snowfall, medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible even below 2000 m.</p>"
