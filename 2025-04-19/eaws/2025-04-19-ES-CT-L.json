        "comment": "In all regions numerous small and medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of the rain. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects below approximately 2600 m. Especially steep shady slopes: The danger of natural moist avalanches will already increase in the early morning. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and wind from southerly directions, wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at elevated altitudes. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized and easily released. Individual large avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> Experience and restraint are required.",
