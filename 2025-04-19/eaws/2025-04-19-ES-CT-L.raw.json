The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects below approximately 2600 m. Especially steep shady slopes: The danger of natural moist avalanches will already increase in the early morning. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and wind from southerly directions, wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at elevated altitudes. In many cases avalanches are medium-sized and easily released. Individual large avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> Experience and restraint are required."

Early and late morning: Up to 2400 m rain will fall. Down to low altitudes snow will fall until the evening. <br/> In particular high altitudes: At the southern border of Aran 25 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall. In the other regions 5 to 20 cm of snow will fall. <br/> At low altitude no snow is lying."
