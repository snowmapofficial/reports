The new snow of the last few days can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on shady slopes. <br/> In starting zones where no previous releases have taken place more occasionally large dry and moist avalanches are possible, especially above approximately 2500 m. In particular on shady slopes the avalanches can be triggered in deep layers of the snowpack. <br/> Adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation this applies in particular. These can in some cases be released easily. <br/> These weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2500 m. Moist avalanches can in some places be released in the weakly bonded old snow. This applies in particular on very steep slopes.",
