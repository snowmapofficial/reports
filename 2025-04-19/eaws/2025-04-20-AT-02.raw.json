These avalanche prone locations are located particularly on very steep slopes below 2800m. Fresh snowdrift accumulations can be triggered by one sole skier on very steep shady slopes above 2800m. Such danger zones occur esp. in ridgeline terrain, in gullies and in bowls. In high-alpine zones, small-to-medium moist loose-snow avalanches can be expected, esp. on extremely steep sunny slopes."

The snowpack surface can barely freeze and softens rapidly. High-alpine zones: up to 20cm of fresh snowfall registered, locally more. Due to fresh fallen snow and often strong southerly winds, small new snowdrift accumulations will be generated. On steep sunny slopes below 1900m there is hardly any snow on the ground."
