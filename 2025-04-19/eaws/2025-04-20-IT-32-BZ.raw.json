      "comment" : "Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes below approximately 2800 m. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. As a consequence of warming during the day there will be only a slight increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow. <br/> <br/> In high Alpine regions small to medium-sized moist loose snow avalanches are possible. In the event of prolonged bright spells this applies in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2800 m. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In particular in high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is greater."

      "comment" : "The rain gave rise to a loss of strength within the snowpack. Already many wet avalanches have been released in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes. The snowpack will be wet all the way through. This applies on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as on sunny slopes below approximately 3000 m. On steep sunny slopes as well as at low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is now lying. The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already be soft in the early morning. <br/> <br/> High Alpine regions: Over a wide area 20 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last few days. As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southeasterly directions, extensive wind slabs formed. These are lying on soft layers on steep shady slopes. The weather effects will foster a rapid strengthening of the snow drift accumulations."
