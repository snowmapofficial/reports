      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from southeasterly directions, extensive wind slabs formed above approximately 2600 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily in some places especially on very steep shady slopes. Especially on very steep west, north and east facing slopes and below approximately 2600 m many wet slab avalanches are to be expected as the penetration by moisture increases. Wet avalanches can as before be released by a single winter sport participant. Dry and moist avalanches are possible, even quite large ones. <br/> As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be a rapid increase in the danger of wet avalanches. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes in the regions with a lot of snow. The conditions are unfavourable for backcountry touring."

In some regions up to 25 cm of snow will fall on Sunday above approximately 2100 m. <br/> Especially high Alpine regions: As a consequence of the southeasterly wind the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. <br/> Towards its surface, the snowpack is moist and its surface has a crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> The sleet gave rise to significant moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2400 m. New snow and wind slabs are lying on a moist old snowpack. <br/> Below approximately 2000 m a little snow is lying."
