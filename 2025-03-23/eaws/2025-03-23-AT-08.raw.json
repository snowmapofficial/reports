One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. Less danger on steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible. With daytime warming and solar radiation, small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible in steep terrain."

In addition, light rainfall up to intermediate altitudes. Steep high-altitude north-facing slopes are often still powdery. Mostly shallow old snowpack surfaces are generally well consolidated. On sunny slopes, the uppermost layers often moisten during daytime hours, at lower altitudes the ground becomes bare of snow. Below 1500m there is little snow on the ground."
