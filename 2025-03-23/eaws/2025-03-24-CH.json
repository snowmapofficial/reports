On the northern flank of the Alps, snowpack structure is otherwise quite favourable. The fresh snow that has fallen in the south over the last few days is lying on a quite favourable old snow surface, but there are weak layers in the middle of the snowpack. The increased load from the fresh snow means that these layers may fracture. In the inneralpine regions of Valais and Grisons, there are weak layers in the snowpack, especially on shady slopes. However, only few avalanches have been triggered.</p><p>Southern slopes are water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions as are western slopes below approximately 2200 m. The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes is only superficially moistened. Despite falling temperatures, it is gliding avalanches that are still the most likely, but higher daytime temperatures and sunshine mean that there is also a possibility of isolated wet snow avalanches.</p>"

On the northern flank of the Alps, snowpack structure is otherwise quite favourable. The fresh snow that has fallen in the south over the last few days is lying on a quite favourable old snow surface, but there are weak layers in the middle of the snowpack. The increased load from the fresh snow means that these layers may fracture. In the inneralpine regions of Valais and Grisons, there are weak layers in the snowpack, especially on shady slopes. However, only few avalanches have been triggered.</p><p>Southern slopes are water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions as are western slopes below approximately 2200 m. The snowpack on northern and eastern slopes is only superficially moistened. Despite falling temperatures, it is gliding avalanches that are still the most likely, but higher daytime temperatures and sunshine mean that there is also a possibility of isolated wet snow avalanches.</p>"

Conditions will be fairly sunny in Valais and mostly sunny in the south. Temperatures will remain pretty low with light winds. The risk of dry avalanches will slowly decrease. As a result of the sunshine, numerous moist loose snow avalanches are expected, especially in regions with fresh snow in the south. Gliding avalanches remain possible in all regions.</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p>There will be heavy cloud cover in the north with a little snowfall. There will be a slight increase in the risk of dry avalanches. There will be sunny spells in Valais and the south. On the southern flank of the Alps, a foehn wind from the north will develop over the course of the day. Freshly drifted snow will somewhat increase the risk of dry avalanches. There will be no significant change in the risk of wet and gliding avalanches.</p>"
