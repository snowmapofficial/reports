In all aspects on steep grass-covered slopes and in forest clearances, glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches can be expected, esp. in afternoon and on south-facing slopes, which can in isolated cases place exposed transportation routes at risk. Open glide cracks are indicators of danger, zones near them should be avoided. Acute danger of falling on steep icy slopes!",
