The fresh wind slabs are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack. They can in some cases be released easily. This applies even in case of a single winter sport participant. <br/> The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2300 m. <br/> In the morning and where less new snow falls, the danger of falling on hard snow remains, so it is advisable to carry snow knives and crampons for the steeper sections.",
