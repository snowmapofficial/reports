The probability of fractures within the new and drift snow layers will decrease. In the north and generally at high altitudes, the surface of the snowpack is shaped by storm-force foehn winds and strong southerly winds. In the regions exposed to the foehn wind, some ridges and surfaces adjacent to ridgelines have been blown completely clear. The wind slabs are mostly medium to large and sometimes prone to triggering.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places and contain hardly any distinct weak layers. Last week, the old snowpack was soaked up to around 3000 m on south-facing slopes, 2000 to 2500 m on east- and west-facing slopes and around 1800 to 2000 m on north-facing slopes.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible in isolated cases, especially on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and on north-facing slopes below approximately 2000 m. These may be large.</p>"
