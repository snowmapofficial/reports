        "comment": "Beware fresh and older snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes. Danger zones occur also distant from ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls; they increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. Medium sized avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Due to warmth and radiation, slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. on sunny slopes. Below 2600 m, glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",

Below 2000 m the old snowpack is thoroughly moist, wet down to the ground, this reinforces gliding over smooth ground. Very little snow on the ground below 1500 m."
