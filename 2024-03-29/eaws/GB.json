Freezing level slowly rose during the morning to around summit level, where it remained for the rest of the day. Winds were light South-Westerly.\nObservedSnowStability: In general, the snowpack is consolidating, and is stable on most aspects and at all elevations. Largest remaining areas of snow are on steep North to East facing slopes above 900 metres. Sun exposed slopes were hard and icy in the morning, but softened during the day, and are establishing a melt freeze crust. The avalanche hazard is Low."
