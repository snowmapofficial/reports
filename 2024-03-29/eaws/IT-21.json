        "comment": "As a consequence of the snowfall the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent as the day progresses. In these regions the avalanche danger will increase during the day to level 3 (considerable). New snow and wind slabs can in many places be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach large size in isolated cases. The more recent wind slabs will be covered with new snow and therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> As the penetration by moisture increases more frequent medium-sized wet slab avalanches are possible below approximately 2000 m. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
