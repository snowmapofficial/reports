        "comment": "Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released by winter sport participants in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution. The weather was mild over a wide area. As a consequence of warming during the day, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase in particular on very steep slopes below approximately 2200 m. The more recent wind slabs are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and generally at high altitudes. They can be released, even by small loads in isolated cases.",
