Windblown slopes and crests are often hard or icy, such danger zones are especially risky for falling. Up to high altitudes the snowpack is very moist-to-wet due to rain impact, can glide over smooth ground. An area-wide snowpack begins only above the treeline."

The precipitation on Saturday was minor (below 2000 m as rain), the fresh snow was moist, thus not transportable. The drop in temperatures on Sunday stabilized the snowpack anew. The minor fresh snow on Monday is not relevant to avalanche danger. On sunny slopes the snowpack is mostly isotherm and moist, shady slopes higher up still have reserves of cold. In steep terrain where the ground is smooth, the snowpack glides downhill. An area-wide snowpack begins only above the treeline."
