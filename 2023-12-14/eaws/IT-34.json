        "comment": "Until Saturday the wind will be strong to storm force at times over a wide area. The wind will transport the new snow and, in some cases, old snow as well. As a consequence of a gathering strong wind from northwesterly directions, large surface-area wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines as well as above the tree line. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes of all aspects above approximately 2000 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. The wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above the tree line.",

This applies in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> The sometimes storm force wind will transport the new snow significantly. In some regions up to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Wednesday above approximately 2000 m. The sleet gave rise to moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2000 m. Snow depths vary greatly at intermediate and high altitudes, depending on the infuence of the wind."
