Inside the old snow weak layers of faceted crystals have formed, also inside snowdrift masses. Particularly on extended S/E facing slopes, the stormy NW winds have generated quite deep snowdrift accumulations. At intermediate altitudes the drifts have bonded better with the moist snowpack and the weak layers occur only at soft inner layers inside the fresh snow. Due to rain impact in recent days, glide-snow avalanches can trigger at any time of day on very steep slopes up to intermediate altitudes."
