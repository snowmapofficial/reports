        "comment": "Until Saturday the wind will be strong in the vicinity of peaks. As a consequence of a gathering strong wind, further wind slabs will form. The wind slabs will form in particular above the tree line. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes of all aspects above approximately 2300 m and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. The wind slabs can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. <br/> At elevated altitudes more medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and wind. <br/>",
