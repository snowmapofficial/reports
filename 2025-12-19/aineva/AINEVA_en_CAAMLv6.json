Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Precarious weak layers exist in the snowpack on shady slopes. In isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach medium size in some cases. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. The numerous rocks hidden by the recent snow are the main danger."
