This applies even in case of a single winter sport participant in some cases. Avalanches can in particular reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> The high humditiy will give rise as the day progresses to moistening of the snowpack in particular at low and intermediate altitudes. On steep east, southeast and south facing slopes and on steep sunny slopes more small and medium-sized moist avalanches are possible as the penetration by moisture increases. <br/> Snow sport activities outside marked and open pistes call for defensive route selection. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain."
