        "SnowDistribution": "Main snow level above 900 metres, wet below this altitude, deeper drifts developing in lee areas.  Good visibility, poor during snow showers. 56 to 60mph winds gusting 90 over the summits.",
        "Comment": "Drifting snow expected at higher elevations, some consolidation at lower levels due to fluctuating temperatures.",

        "SnowStability": "Drifting snow expected at the highest levels; unstable windslab will be present on North-West through North to East aspects above 1000 metres.  Areas especially affected will be steep wind sheltered locations such as gully exits, coire rims and crag aprons. Cornices will be unstable. At lower elevations recent windslab accumulations will begin to consolidate. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

The greatest instability is within deeper deposits in steep terrain around coire rims, the tops of gullies and crag aprons.  Fragile cornices have developed on these aspects.

        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will be around 1000 metres for most of the period. Overnight Friday, light snow showers falling mainly above 900 metres accompanied by strong South-Westerly winds. During the day mostly dry conditions maybe an odd isolated shower winds will become South-Easterly remaining strong or even gale force particularly over the higher summits.",
        "SnowStability": "Poorly bonded windslab deposits will continue to develop in wind sheltered locations but are not expected to be deep or extensive. Greatest accumulations mainly on North to Easterly aspects above 950 metres. Corrie rims and sheltered gully exits mostly affected. Fragile cornices continue to develop above similar aspects. As the strong winds become South-Easterly some snow redistribution may form isolated pockets on shallow windslab on NW aspects above 950m. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

This morning snow fell mainly above 800 metres  accompanied by very strong to gale force South-Westerly winds. The freezing level was around 850 metres and slowly climbed to nearly 1050 metres in the afternoon and snow turned to rain below 900 metres.",

Shallow areas of poorly bonded windslab has formed mainly on North to Easterly aspects above 950 metres. Corrie rims and sheltered gully exits are particularly affected. Small fragile cornices are also developing above similar aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

However, some deep deposits of moderately bonded soft windslab will remain in sheltered locations on mainly North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Some fragile cornices will exist above these aspects.  On other aspects and below 1000 metres altitude the snowpack will tend to be shallower and stability better.

Generally the snowpack here will begin to consolidate in the milder temperatures but some weaknesses will persist in the windslab where it achieves depth. Mostly present in wind sheltered locations around coire rims, gully tops and ridge flanks on North-West through North to Easterly aspects.
