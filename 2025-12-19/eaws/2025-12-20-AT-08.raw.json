The temperatures are expected to remain unchanged, quite mild. Temperature at 2000m: +3 degrees; at 3000m: -3 degrees. Predominantly weak to moderate-velocity southerly winds at high altitudes."

      "comment" : "In very isolated cases avalanches can be triggered from persistent weak layers on very steep shady slopes. These releases are mostly small-sized. The risks of falling and sustaining injuries outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. From place to place, freshly generated snowdrifts require attentiveness. Isolated, generally small-sized glide-snow avalanches are still possible on steep, smooth slopes which have not yet discharged."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The shallow snowpack is well consolidated for the most part and low in tensions. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers inside the snowpack still occur. South-facing slopes are already bare of snow up to high altitudes. Since there is little snow to be transported, the strong-velocity southerly winds of recent days generated only small-sized snowdrift accumulations. There is currently little data from outlying terrain available to the Avalanche Warning Services."
