On wind-loaded slopes small dry avalanches are possible. In particular in the south and in the east and above approximately 2200 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> In particular areas where the snow cover is rather shallow, shady slopes: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases in particular adjacent to ridgelines. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for caution and restraint. <br/> <br/>"},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Yesterday the wind was moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines in particular in the south and in the southwest. The southerly wind has transported the new snow significantly. The fresh and older wind slabs are lying on unfavourable layers in particular on shady slopes in high Alpine regions. Field observations and stability tests confirm this situation. <br/> Sunny slopes as well as low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will hardly soften at all. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Slight increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the precipitation.","tendencyType":"increasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-20T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-21T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-20"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"wind_slab","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","E","N","W"]},{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2300"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","E","N"]}],"bulletinID":"d7e6e20e-526c-477c-8c75-cc839936a91b","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
