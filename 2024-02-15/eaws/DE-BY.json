        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low in the morning, rising to moderate (Danger Level 2) above 1800 m during the course of the day. Main problem: wet snow. Moist and wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger in steep rocky terrain, in isolated cases wet glide-snow avalanches can trigger natureally on very steep slopes over smooth ground. Frequency and size of avalanches increase as the day progresses. At high altitudes, wet snow avalanches will be maximum medium-sized.\r\nSmall snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes can be problematic. Isolated danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain on N/E/SE facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small slabs can be triggered by 1 person. Danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow masses.",
