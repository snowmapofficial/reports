As a consequence of a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, clearly visible wind slabs formed. <br/> <br/> The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day, especially at intermediate altitudes. <br/> <br/> The snowpack remains subject to considerable local variations. Within the snowpack, there are multiple melt-freeze crusts sandwiches with faceted layers in between, in particular on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones, as well as on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m. <br/> <br/> At low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is lying."
