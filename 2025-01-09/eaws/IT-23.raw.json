The avalanche prone locations are to be found in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The fresh snow of the last few days and very particularly the wind slabs can be released easily or naturally. In some places avalanches can be released in the new snow and wind slab layers and reach large size, in particular along the border with France. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist avalanches are possible below approximately 2300 m. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads especially between approximately 2700 and 3000 m, caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. <br/> Whumpfing sounds are a clear indication."
