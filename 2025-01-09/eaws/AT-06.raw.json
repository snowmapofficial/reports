The snowfall level will drop down to the valleys. In the Niedere Tauern and the northern Kalkalpen (Dachsteingebirge to Hochschwab), 5 to 15 cm of fresh snow is expected. From the morning hours onwards, the snowfall will subside and retreat to the Nordstau region. At the same time, the wind will turn more and more to the north. It will remain stormy in the east of Styria. Mostly sunny conditions are expected from midday, but the winds will continue to blow strongly. Temperatures at an altitude of 2000 m will be a wintry -10 degrees."
