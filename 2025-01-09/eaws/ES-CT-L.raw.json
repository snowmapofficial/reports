      "comment" : "The soft wind slabs of the last few days are lying on a crust in particular on shady slopes. The avalanches can sometimes be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2000 m and at transitions into gullies and bowls. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated small moist loose snow slides are possible in all altitude zones."

      "comment" : "5 to 10 cm of snow fell on Monday above approximately 2000 m. <br/> Shady slopes: The snowpack is favourably layered and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a strong melt-freeze crust. As a consequence of the moderate southwesterly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations formed. <br/> Sunny slopes and low altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 80 cm of snow. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
