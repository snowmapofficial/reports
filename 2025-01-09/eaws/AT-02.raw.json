The freshly generated drifts can be triggered even by one sole skier. Isolated dry-snow avalanches also possible, esp. in the major areas of participation. Releases will be mostly small-sized, medium-sized in isolated cases. Size of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, at 1200-1600m, wet loose-snow avalanches can be expected, small releases. Their runout zones should be circumvented."

Often stormy winds will transport the fresh fallen snow. The fresh snowdrift accumulations will be deposited atop a weak old snowpack surface particularly on shady slopes and be poorly bonded to it. Further snowdrifts will accumulate during the course of the day above 1800m atop a weak snowpack. Rainfall is expected up to 1800m widespread, leading to widespread loss of firmness inside the snowpack."
