        "comment": "An increasing number of small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected as the moisture increases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes below approximately 2300 m and on very steep grassy slopes. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a freshening northwesterly wind, mostly small wind slabs will form in the course of the day in particular adjacent to ridgelines as well as at high altitude. The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on weak layers in particular on shady slopes. The snow sport conditions outside marked and open pistes are unfavourable.",
