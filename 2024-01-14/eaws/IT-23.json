As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from northwesterly directions, further wind slabs will form in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes above approximately 2200 m. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. <br/> Along the border between Valais and France In some localities up to 20 cm of snow will fall on Monday above approximately 2000 m. Here the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. In the course of the day in some localities danger level 3 (considerable) will be reached in these regions above approximately 2200 m. <br/> Fresh wind slabs are in many cases extensive and to be assessed with care and prudence. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. <br/> Several mostly small natural avalanches are possible as a consequence of the moderate to strong wind.",
