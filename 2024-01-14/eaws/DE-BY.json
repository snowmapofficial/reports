Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain in NW/E/S facing terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and forest clearances. Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as slab avalanches even by 1 person. Avalanches can reach medium size. Caution towards dangers of being swept along and falling.In addition, in extremely steep terrain, naturally triggered small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches can be expected.",
