At higher altitudes the melt-freeze crust remains hard on the shady side; on the sunny side and in the forest it softens during the course of the day. The consequence: deep sink-in depths. Up to high altitude the snowpack is thoroughly moist and frequently wet down to the ground. Intermediate layers in and around old snowdrift accumulations and melt-freeze crusts are no longer prone to triggering. Below 1500 m more and more surfaces are becoming bare of snow. It is now almost impossible  to go backcountry skiing in the Bavarian Alps without having to carry the skis for part of the route."
