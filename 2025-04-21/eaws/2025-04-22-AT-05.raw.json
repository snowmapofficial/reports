In isolated cases, avalanches in the old snow can fracture down to deeper layers and grow to medium size. On steep slopes below 2800m which have not yet discharged, naturally triggered avalanches can release due to solar radiation and grown to medium size, or else be trigger b persons. Also isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible."

Southerly winds have formed snowdrift accumulations there, often deposited atop faceted expansively metamorphosed crystals and prone to triggering in places. Higher daytime temperatures and solar raditaion moisten the snowpack and cause firmness to be forfeited."
