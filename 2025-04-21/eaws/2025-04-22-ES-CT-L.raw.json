      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and wind from southerly directions, wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at elevated altitudes. They are to be found in particular on northwest, north and east facing slopes. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized and can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> At the border to Ribagorça and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. Large avalanches are still not ruled out. <br/> <br/> Especially on steep sunny slopes and at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any more small and medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger."
