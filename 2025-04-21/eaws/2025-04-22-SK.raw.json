      "comment" : "In the high altitudes of the Western, High and Low Tatras (above 1700 m above sea level) there is a SMALL avalanche danger, level 1. Due to rain and warming, the main avalanche problem is wet snow. Steep slopes, couloirs, and leeward places of the highest altitudes, where a larger amount of snow is concentrated, are dangerous. Here it is possible to release an avalanche, especially with a large additional load.",
      "highlights" : "Mostly favourable situation, watch out for wet snow on steep slopes."
