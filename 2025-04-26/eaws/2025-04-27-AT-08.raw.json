      "comment" : "Fresh snowfall and small fresh snowdrifts are increasingly prone to triggering with ascending altitude. Avalanche prone locations occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts, In isolated cases, small glide-snow avalanches are also possible. A cautious route selection is recommended. During the course of the day due to solar radiation and higher daytime temperatures, increasingly frequent moist slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible. Backcountry ski tours should be launched early and come to an end early in the day."

In seldom-tracked terrain on shady steep slopes in high-alpine zones, there are unfavorable intermediate layers inside the snowpack. There have, however, been now avalanches reported over the last few days. Very little information from outlying terrain is available to the Avalanche Warning Service.
