Here, dry slab avalanches are most likely to be triggered at the point of transition to the old snowpack. The instabilities within the layers of new and drifted snow have largely stabilised.</p><p>The old snowpack is water-saturated on southern slopes up to the high Alpine regions and on eastern and western slopes up to around 3000 m. On northern slopes, most of the old snowpack is water-saturated up to between 2600 and 2800 m. Particularly in the inneralpine regions of Grisons, fractures in the old snowpack are still possible at this altitude when weak layers initially become moist. During the overcast night into Sunday, hardly any strong crust will form. As temperatures rise in the daytime, wet and gliding avalanches will be possible as early as the late morning.</p>"
