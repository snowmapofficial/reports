Due to fresh snow and moderate-velocity winds, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been generated over the course of the day which can be triggered by one sole skier, but will be mostly small-sized releases. Caution urged in gullies and bowls and behind protruberances in the terrain along the Salzburg border.Danger zones occur above 2600m. Isolated danger zones occur also on sunny slopes in high-alpine zones.",
