        "comment": "Fresh snowfall and small fresh snowdrifts are increasingly prone to triggering with ascending altitude. Avalanche prone locations occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small triggerings are possible by winter sports enthusiasts, In isolated cases, small glide-snow avalanches are also possible. A cautious route selection is recommended. During the course of the day due to solar radiation and higher daytime temperatures, increasingly frequent moist slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible. Backcountry ski tours should be launched early and come to an end early in the day.",
        "highlights": "Beware: small snowdrifts at high altitude and daytime rise in avalanche danger."
