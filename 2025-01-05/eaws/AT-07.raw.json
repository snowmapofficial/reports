Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Mostly avalanches are only small. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

Hard wind slabs are lying on soft layers at elevated altitudes. <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The snowpack consists of faceted crystals and its surface has a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, small wind slabs formed in the last few days in isolated cases. The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations."
