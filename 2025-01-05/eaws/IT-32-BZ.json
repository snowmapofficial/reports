Caution is to be exercised in particular on steep shady slopes in areas close to the tree line and above the tree line. The fresh wind slabs can in some cases be released easily. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can additionally in very isolated cases be released in the weakly bonded old snow. These avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, caution is to be exercised in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow, as well as at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. Avalanches can reach medium size.",
