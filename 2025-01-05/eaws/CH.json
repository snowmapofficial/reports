On the one hand, there is an angular layer under the last new snow and drift snow, which fell during the night to Friday. In addition, there are widespread angular weak layers deep in the snowpack. Avalanches are still possible in weak layers near the ground, especially from southern Valais via Ticino to Grisons, and may still become large.
