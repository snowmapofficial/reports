Slab avalanches can trigger by minimum additional loading both in fresh (Thursday night) and older (southerly foehn-induced on Wednesday and Thursday) snowdrift accumulations near to and distant from ridgelines. The slabs are mostly small, but if fractures go down to lower layers in the snowpack the releases can grow to medium size. Most danger zones are on N/E facing slopes, higher up also on south-facing slopes. Most critical are transitions from shallow to deeper snow and at entries into gullies filled with drifts.",
