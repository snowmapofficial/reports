Danger zones occur in wind-loaded steep terrain, in gullies and bowls, and behind protruberances in the landscape. Size and frequency of danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, isolated slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading.  In zones where there has been rain impact, slides and small wet-snow avalanches are possible. Glide-snow avalanches, mostly small, continue to be possible. Caution urged below glide cracks.",
