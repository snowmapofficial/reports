Overnight snowfall, which will continue during the day, will bring a total of 10 to 20 cm of new snow. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. All orientations are dangerous. Watch out for narrow couloirs, leeward sides of ridges and places under rock walls. Here there may be wind-beaten slabs and pillows that are deposited on hard ground. The two layers are weakly interconnected. Small to medium avalanches are expected and pose a risk, especially in combination with terrain traps.",

The snowfall will be accompanied by strong winds, so the snow will be mostly packed down into slabs and pillows of varying hardness. Where wind stability is less, the snow will be loose, powdery. Peaks and ridges are blown into hard ground. On average there is between 20 and 60 cm of snow in our mountains. A continuous snow cover is mostly found above the forest belt."

Overnight snowfall, which will continue during the day, will bring a total of 5 to 10 cm of new snow. The wind has varied over the last few days, therefore snow slabs may be blown on almost all slopes, except on ridges and backs, from where the snow is blown. The danger is concentrated on slopes with a high gradient and in places where old hard snow was present, especially in gullies and moguls. Due to the overall very low snow cover, only small avalanches and avalanches are a risk, especially in combination with terrain traps.",
