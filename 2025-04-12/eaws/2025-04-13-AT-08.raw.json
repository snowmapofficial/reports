Naturally triggered wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can be expected, reaching medium size in high-altitude starting zones. Wet-snow avalanches can be triggered by persons in steep terrain. Due to rainfall, danger below 2400m could rise to Danger Level 3, considerable. In addition, the old snowpack can be triggered by persons, small-to-medium releases. Danger zones occur esp. on very steep NW/N/NE-facing slopes and are difficult to recognize. Backcounry tours require a cautious route selection.
