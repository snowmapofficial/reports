All aspects: As the penetration by moisture increases wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected at any time, even large ones in isolated cases. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally."

Several medium-sized to large moist slab avalanches have been released in the last few days. The surface of the snowpack will freeze very little. The rain will give rise as the day progresses to increasing and thorough wetting of the old snowpack in particular on shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes."
