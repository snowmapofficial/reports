During tomorrow morning, the weather will be influenced by a pressure high, which will bring clear and warm weather. The snow from the last snowfall period, which fell in windy and cold weather, is lying on top of the old snow cover, while the bonds between these layers are weak. The strong radiation of the spring sun will have a significant effect on the layer of puffed new snow, which will be heavily packed during tomorrow morning. Avalanche release will be possible, especially on steep sunlit slopes in the south, while spontaneous avalanches and smaller avalanches are also expected during the day. In the afternoon, a pressure low will hit our area, which will bring clouds and sunburn will be less pronounced, but will bring precipitation, which will also be of a rainy nature at the highest altitudes - soaking of the snow cover will continue.",

During tomorrow morning the weather will be influenced by the pressure high, which will bring clear and warm weather. The last period of snowfall affected the eastern part of the Low Tatras only marginally, locally on the leeward sides it is possible to find smaller amounts of new snow lying on top of the old snow cover, while the bonds between these layers are weak. The strong radiation of the spring sun will have a significant effect on the layer of inflated new snow, which will be intensively packed during tomorrow morning.
