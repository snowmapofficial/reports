        "comment": "As a consequence of high temperatures, rain up to high altitudes and the moderate southerly wind, no crust will develop on the surface during the course of the night. All aspects: As the penetration by moisture increases wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected at any time, even large ones in isolated cases. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally.",

The rain will give rise as the day progresses to increasing and thorough wetting of the old snowpack in particular on shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes."
