This applies above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of rising temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface, in particular on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack, especially on sunny slopes, and on shady slopes at intermediate altitudes."
