Light precipitation will give a slight dusting of new snow mainly above 950 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: Overnight, the freezing level was well above the highest summits and rain fell at all levels. Today, after a damp start  it became dry and quite bright. The winds were strong for most of the day from a South-Westerly direction.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack is moist at all levels but is generally well bonded and stable in most locations.
