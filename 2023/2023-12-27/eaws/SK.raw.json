During Wednesday, we recorded an influx of higher air pressure, which was accompanied by strong winds and cooling. This situation had a positive effect on the stability of the snow cover, but at the same time it created a hard, sometimes icy layer on the surface of the snow cover at high altitudes in many places. Strong winds and overnight precipitation caused the main avalanche problem - wind-blown snow - on the northeast, east and southeast orientations of the slopes above the tree line. In such places, especially on very steep leeward slopes, there are localised slabs and pillows of unstable packed snow lying on frozen ground. We expect the weather to warm up again during Wednesday, with the snow cover melting during the day. Smaller spontaneous avalanches may occur on sunlit slopes in the south.",

Only 15 cm of new snow fell in the eastern part of the Low Tatras during the last snowfall period (Friday-Sunday). Due to the subsequent warming, the snow cover lost its height significantly and then froze during the night due to the cooling. A crust formed at lower altitudes up to the level of the upper forest boundary, while a thick layer of ice formed at higher altitudes, especially on the ridges."
