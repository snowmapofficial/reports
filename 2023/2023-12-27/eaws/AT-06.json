In all aspects on steep grass-covered slopes and in forest clearances, glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches can be expected, esp. in afternoon on south-facing slopes, which can in isolated cases place exposed transportation routes at risk. Open glide cracks are indicators of danger, zones near them should be avoided.",
