      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already soften in the late morning. Individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on extremely steep sunny slopes. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

      "comment" : "The snowpack is stable and its surface has a melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> In particular shady slopes: Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. <br/> At high altitude there are 30 to 50 cm of snow. In all regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
