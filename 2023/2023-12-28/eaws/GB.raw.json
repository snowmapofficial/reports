        "Summary": "CM for 29.12 Old snowpack generally good stability. Fresh unstable windslab mostly on N, NE, E and SE aspects above 900m. Mod hazard",
        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snow cover, better above 700 metres.  Cloud base was at 900 metres, lower in the showers.   Winds 20 -30 mph.",
        "Comment": "Returning to cooler temperatures tomorrow as freezing level drops throughout the day. Snowpack will firm up and paths will become icy as the freezing level lowers.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Strong South-Westerly winds will veer North-Westerly and decrease overnight, to become fresh to moderate. Frequent showers overnight, falling as snow above around 900 metres, will ease during the day and fall as snow to progressively lower levels. The freezing level will be around 900 metres initially and drop steadily to reach 400 metres by the end of the forecasting period.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing generally moist snowpack will continue to consolidate and will firm up through the day as the freezing level drops. Shallow accumulations of fresh unstable windslab will build overnight and throughout the day on mainly North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Areas most affected will be coire rims and gully tops. Elsewhere any new snow will fall mostly on bare ground. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Strong South-Westerly winds. Frequent showers, mostly falling as snow above around 800 metres. The freezing level fluctuated between 800 and 1000 metres.",

Some instabilities remain in deeper accumulations above 900 metres mostly on West through North to East aspects, particularly around coire rims and gully tops. Little snow remains below 600 metres.
