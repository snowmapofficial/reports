        "comment": "The surface of the snowpack will cool hardly at all during the overcast night and will already soften in the late morning. Individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on extremely steep sunny slopes. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",

In all regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
