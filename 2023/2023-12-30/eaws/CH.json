The surface of the snowpack is often icy and slippery. There is hardly any transportable old snowpack left. The snowpack structure is generally favourable. No more avalanches triggered by people have been reported in the last three days.</p><p>Last week, numerous gliding avalanches occurred naturally. These occurred on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below around 2500 m and, somewhat less frequently, on north-facing slopes below around 2200 m.
