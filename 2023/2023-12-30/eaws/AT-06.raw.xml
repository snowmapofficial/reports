          <avActivityHighlights>Moderate danger continues due to naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger is moderate at all altitudes due to naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches. In all aspects on steep grass-covered slopes and in forest clearances, glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches can be expected, esp. in afternoon and on south-facing slopes, which can in isolated cases place exposed transportation routes at risk. Open glide cracks are indicators of danger, zones near them should be avoided. Acute danger of falling on steep icy slopes!</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Very irregular snow distribution. Whereas NW-facing slopes and exposed zones are often bare of snow, grass-covered wind-loaded slopes and gullies are filled to the brim. The snowpack is compact, without marked weak layers. Below 2000 m the snowpack is nearly isotherm, the ground is often wet. The snowpack is gliding downhill over smooth ground.&#13;
The snowpack surface below 2200 m is often riddled with water seepage channels (highly unpleasant for skiers), at high altitudes frozen and capable of bearing loads and on sunny slopes turn to firn snow in daytime hours.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>During the nocturnal hours the high-altitude airstream will shift from westerly to southwesterly. On New Year’s Eve, clouds will move over the southern flank of the Alps bringing a bit of rainfall; the northern flank of the Alps will be slightly foehn-impacted. By evening an Atlantic cold front will reach all of Styria from the northwest with precipitation and pass through on the night of New Year’s Eve. Above 1000 m (in the north) to 1200 m (in the south) 5-15 cm of fresh snow is anticipated. Winds will be moderate to brisk, von Gurktal and Seetal Alps to rimline ranges also stormy, from SE to SW. In the north at 2000 m: + 2 degrees; at 1500 m: +3 degrees. On the southern flank of the Alps, about 3 degrees lower.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>On New Year’s Day, clouds will disperse gradually as the front passes by and it will turn quite a bit colder. Esp. on the eastern rim of the Alps a storm-strength W/NW wind will be blowing, through which fresh snowdrift patches can be generated.</tendencyComment>

          <avActivityHighlights>Generally low danger but caution urged towards isolated naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger is generally low, but pay close heed to small, naturally triggered wet-snow and glide-snow slides esp on south-facing slopes during the course of the day. Danger zones occur on very steep grass-covered slopes, hillsides and in forest clearances. Open glide cracks are indicators of danger, avoid zones below them. Beware falls on steep icy slopes!</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Snow distribution is highly diverse. Whereas northwest-facing and wind-exposed slopes are often completely bare of snow, wind-loaded slopes and gullies are filled to the brim. The snowpack is compact and without marked weak layers. Below 2000 m it is nearly isotherrm, almost zero degrees, and wet at ground level. The snowpack glides downhill over smooth ground. The surface below 2200 m is filled with rain seepage channels, highly unpleasant for skiers; at high altitudes it is frozen and capable of bearing loads, and can turn to firn on sunny slopes by midday.</snowpackStructureComment>

          <avActivityComment>Above 1500 m avalanche danger is moderate. Based on open glide cracks, glide-snow avalanches cannot be excluded. Danger zones occur on steep grass-covered slopes, hillsides and in forest clearances. Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger, they should be circumvented. Acute danger of falling on steep icy slopes.</avActivityComment>
