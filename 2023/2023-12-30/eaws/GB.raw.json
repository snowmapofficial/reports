        "Summary": "NC for 31.12. Unstable windslab rapidly building W,NW,N and NE aspects above 800 metres. Fresh cornices. Avalanche Hazard Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wind scoured and icy on aspects exposed to the wind.  Blizzard and whiteout conditions presenting challenging and serious conditions. Later, winds of approximately 75 mph and above aloft.",
        "Comment": "Uncertainty as to snow amounts and freezing level in the east of the Northern Cairngorms area, due to the passage of a complex frontal system.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation overnight is expected to fall as snow showers above 900 metres initially, and later above 750 metres. A dry day will follow with fresh to strong winds from the South-South-East, backing to become Easterly by the end of the period. The freezing level will be around 900 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Poorly bonded windslab will be deposited overnight and as the day progresses on West through North-West to North-East aspects above 800 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims, ridge flanks and gully tops will be most affected. Other aspects will be subject to crossloading. Fresh and unstable cornices will develop above the same aspects. Areas exposed to the wind will be icy, scoured and predominately stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight, light precipitation fell as snow above 500 metres. After a dry morning precipitation resumed in the afternoon, falling as snow again above around 500 metres. Winds were from the West-North-West initially veering to become storm force South-Easterly by mid morning. The freezing level was around 800 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is generally stable on most aspects and altitudes, featuring a firm crust. Localised deposits of poorly bonded windslab developed mainly during the afternoon on West to North aspects above 850 metres. These were generally confined to wind sheltered locations and steep banks. Areas exposed to the wind are firm, icy and scoured. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Variable underfoot conditions; neve, breakable crust and soft snow all observed and walk through today.  Clear in the morning with poor visibility in clouds and snow afternoon Winds on the summits gusting 75 mph and above, serious and challenging conditions.",
        "Comment": "Stormy conditions on Saturday, a quieter day expected on Sunday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A more settled day is expected. It will be cloudy but generally dry. South-Easterly winds will ease and back to the East . The freezing level will be around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain in sheltered locations on West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. These areas will not be particularly extensive. In locations exposed to the recent strong winds the snowpack will generally tend to be shallow and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After a dry and frosty night the South-Easterly wind quickly increased to storm force during the morning. There were some snow showers late morning and through the afternoon. However, the strong winds meant much of this fresh snow was blown off the mountains. The freezing level was around 400 metres, rising slightly through the afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Areas of moderately bonded windslab remain in sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Through the day West and North-West aspects were also affected by fresh deposits. However, the areas of windslab tend to be relative limited in both depth and size. Exposed windward slopes are scoured and hold little snow. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
