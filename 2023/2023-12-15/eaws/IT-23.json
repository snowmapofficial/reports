        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from northwesterly directions, large surface-area wind slabs formed since Wednesday above approximately 2100 m. <br/> Avalanches can be released, even by small loads in isolated cases, especially on very steep slopes above approximately 2500 m, and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. At elevated altitudes the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. <br/> Meticulous route selection is important. Maintaining distances between individuals and one-at-a-time descents are recommended. The presence of numerous potentially unstable frames is noted, attention to the areas below. <br/> At high altitude individual medium-sized dry avalanches are possible as a consequence of the moderate northerly wind. <br/> As a consequence of warming and solar radiation a very high danger of moist snow slides will prevail. This applies on extreme sunny slopes, and in steep rocky terrain below approximately 2700 m.",
