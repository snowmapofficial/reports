Mostly avalanches are medium-sized and can be released even by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In the regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 3 (considerable) the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in very isolated cases in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, especially in the north. The avalanche prone locations are rather rare. Avalanches can reach medium size.",
