Windward locations such as peaks, ridgelines and crests are often blown off down to the ground, or the crusts from November are blown off. There are large, often compact and hard snowdrift accumulations at a distance from ridgelines. The surface of the snowpack is often icy and slippery. There is hardly any transportable snow left. The snowpack structure is generally favourable. However, individual fractures in near-surface layers or also in deeper layers are still possible.</p><p>There are many glide cracks below approximately 2400 m, except on the southern flank of the Alps. So far, gliding avalanches have mainly occurred on east-, south- and west-facing slopes. They were less prevalent on northern slopes and mostly occurred below approximately 2200 m. Gliding avalanches can be triggered at any time of day or night and can be quite large.</p>"

Windward locations such as peaks, ridgelines and crests are often blown off down to the ground, or the crusts from November are blown off. There are large, often compact and hard snowdrift accumulations at a distance from ridgelines. The surface of the snowpack is often icy and slippery. There is hardly any transportable snow left. The snowpack structure is generally favourable. However, individual fractures in near-surface layers or also in deeper layers are still possible.</p><p>There are many glide cracks below approximately 2400 m, except on the southern flank of the Alps. So far, gliding avalanches have mainly occurred on east-, south- and west-facing slopes. They were less prevalent on northern slopes and mostly occurred below approximately 2200 m. Gliding avalanches can be triggered at any time of day or night and can be quite large.</p>"
