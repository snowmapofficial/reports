Main problem: gliding snow. \r\nUp to 2600 m glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally at any time of day, esp. on steep slopes with smooth ground (grass, rocks) in all aspects. Avalanches can grow to medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks.\r\nSnowdrift accumulations can be triggered only in few places above 2600 m, esp. by large additional loading (a group, breaking cornice, glide-snow avalanche) and grow to large size.\r\nDue to solar radiation and higher temperatures, loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. on south-facing slopes, and can grow to medium size.",

Up to 2300 m the snowpack surface is riddled with water seepage channels, up to 2700 m there is a surface crust. On Tuesday night the uppermost layer will freeze down to low altitudes, form a crust capable of bearing loads.\r\nWide-ranging snowdrift accumulations have been generated at high altitudes, on shady slopes deposited atop a loose layer of faceted crystals. Even where the snowpack surface was encrusted, a faceted layer could have formed before the snow fell. In high alpine zones above 2800 m the old snowpack base has faceted crystals near the crusts.\r\nInside the snow from last weekend above 2700 m there are several icy films resulting from the fluctuating snowfall leels On high shady slopes there are faceted crystals beneath these films.\r\nThe ground is warm, thus, the entire snowpack is gliding downhill over smooth surfaces."
