The freezing level will be around 800 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: A day of poor visibility with very light rain falling as a dusting of snow above 950 metres. The freezing level was around 1000 metres. Winds were fresh and from the East.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack is moist and consolidated in most locations, with a widespread soft crust. Stability was observed to be good, as the snow pack continues to consolidate in the fluctuating temperatures. Cornices were observed above Northerly aspects around coire rims. The avalanche hazard is Low."
