The new snow and wind slabs are lying on a crust below approximately 2600 m. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. Snow depths vary greatly above the tree line, depending on the infuence of the wind. <br/> <br/> From a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
