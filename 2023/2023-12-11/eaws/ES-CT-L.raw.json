These conditions will facilitate a stabilisation of the snowpack by midday in all aspects. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 15 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. Below approximately 1800 m from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."
