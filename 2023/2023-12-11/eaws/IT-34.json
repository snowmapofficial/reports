The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence above approximately 2200 m. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection.",
