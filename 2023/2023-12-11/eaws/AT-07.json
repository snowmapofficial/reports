The large quantity of fresh snow and the sometimes large wind slabs remain prone to triggering. Single winter sport participants can release avalanches easily. In some places these can penetrate even deep layers and reach large size. Such avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore barely recognisable. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm indicating the danger. <br/> <br/> A substantial danger of gliding avalanches exists. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. In addition at low and intermediate altitudes, wet loose snow slides are possible. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example.
