          <avActivityHighlights>Widespread considerable danger, at high altitudes high danger. Still beware gliding snow.</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Large amounts of fresh fallen snow and storm winds are leading to massive snowdrift accumulations also in steep terrain distant from ridges which are easily triggered, in all aspects. Danger zones will increase as the day progresses and with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can reach medium to large size. The possibility of naturally triggered releases will increase during the course of the day, they can place exposed transportation routes at risk.&#13;
Glide-snow avalanches can still release at any time of day in all aspects on very steep wooded or leafy slopes and on smooth rocky slopes.&#13;
At low and intermediate altitudes the rain impact is leading to wet-snow slides on steep hillsides and forest slopes, depending on the fluctuating snowfall level.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>In the barrier cloud regions, large amounts of fresh snow will fall, leading to deep snowdrift accumulations down to the timberline. Weak layers are forming inside the bonded snow (soft deposits). In addition, bonding to the encrusted snowpack with faceted crystals on the surface or near crusts is poor. Rain impact is destabilizing the snowpack and making it forfeit its firmness. The snowpack base is moist/wet up to intermediate altitudes, leading to a gliding snow problem</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>As a consequence of the stormy NW air current, instable air masses are moving into the northern flank of the Alps. Strong storm winds from the NW are blowing, including even stronger gusts in exposed terrain. Snowfall in northern Upper Styria is heavy, by Friday night up to 100 cm of fresh snow is possible. Also in Niedere Tauern, frequent snowfall will be heavy, up to 60 cm of fresh snow is possible in high alpine regions. On the southern flank of the Alps, less fresh snow is anticipated, up to 40 cm is expected from Gurktal Alps to Gleinalm, depending on how much the snowfall extends over the Alps; less in the eastern rimline ranges. Snowfall level will fluctuate in the eastern part of the Northern Alps between the valley floor and 1000 m, towards Turrach and Seetal Alps at 1000-1300 m. Less snowfall is expected along the Styrian rimline ranges, particularly in Koralpe. At 2000 m: -6 degrees; on the southern flank of the Alps, -3 degrees.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>On Friday night and during the daytime hours on Saturday, often heavy snowfall in the northern barrier cloud regions with ongoingly storm-strength (plus gusts) NW winds. Snowfall level at 700-1000 m, in the south at 1000-1300 m, lowest in the eastern regions. Avalanche danger will continue to increase.</tendencyComment>

          <avActivityComment>Large amounts of fresh fallen snow and storm winds are leading to massive snowdrift accumulations which are easily triggered, esp. in N/E/S aspects above 1600 m. Unfavourable: entries into gullies and bowls, behind protruberances in the terrain. Slab avalanches can trigger even from the weight of 1 persons, mostlyly small-to-medium size.&#13;
Glide-snow avalanches can still release at any time of day in all aspects on very steep wooded or leafy slopes and on smooth rocky slopes.</avActivityComment>

          <avActivityHighlights>Moderate avalanche danger. Beware snowdrifts.</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Fresh snow and storm winds near to and distant from ridgelines are generating easily triggered snowdrift accumulations in steep terrain. Danger zones increase during the course of the day and with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person, small-to-medium sized.&#13;
Glide-snow avalanches can still release at any time of day in all aspects on very steep wooded or leafy slopes and on smooth rocky slopes.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Some fresh snowfall and stormy winds are leading to small snowdrift accumulations down to forest clearances. Weak layers are forming inside the bonded snow (soft deposits). The snowpack base is moist/wet up to intermediate altitudes, leading to a gliding snow problem.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>As a consequence of the stormy NW air current, instable air masses are moving into the northern flank of the Alps. Strong storm winds from the NW are blowing, including even stronger gusts in exposed terrain. Snowfall in northern Upper Styria is heavy, by Friday night up to 100 cm of fresh snow is possible. Also in Niedere Tauern, frequent snowfall will be heavy, up to 60 cm of fresh snow is possible in high alpine regions. On the southern flank of the Alps, less fresh snow is anticipated, up to 40 cm is expected from Gurktal Alps to Gleinalm, depending on how much the snowfall extends over the Alps; less in the eastern rimline ranges. Snowfall level will fluctuate in the eastern part of the Northern Alps between the valley floor and 1000 m, towards Turrach and Seetal Alps at 1000-1300 m. Less snowfall is expected along the Styrian rimline ranges, particularly in Koralpe. At 2000 m: -6 degrees; on the southern flank of the Alps, -3 degrees.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>On Friday night and during the daytime hours on Saturday, ongoingly storm-strength (plus gusts) NW winds. Snowfall level at 1000-1300 m. Avalanche danger will increase.</tendencyComment>
