        "comment": "As a consequence of the stormy NW air current, instable air masses are moving into the northern flank of the Alps. Strong storm winds from the NW are blowing, including even stronger gusts in exposed terrain. Snowfall in northern Upper Styria is heavy, by Friday night up to 100 cm of fresh snow is possible. Also in Niedere Tauern, frequent snowfall will be heavy, up to 60 cm of fresh snow is possible in high alpine regions. On the southern flank of the Alps, less fresh snow is anticipated, up to 40 cm is expected from Gurktal Alps to Gleinalm, depending on how much the snowfall extends over the Alps; less in the eastern rimline ranges. Snowfall level will fluctuate in the eastern part of the Northern Alps between the valley floor and 1000 m, towards Turrach and Seetal Alps at 1000-1300 m. Less snowfall is expected along the Styrian rimline ranges, particularly in Koralpe. At 2000 m: -6 degrees; on the southern flank of the Alps, -3 degrees."
