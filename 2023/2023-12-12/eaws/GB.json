Winds will be very strong and from the East-North-East overnight, decreasing to become fresh from the South-East by midday. The freezing level is expected to be around 800 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: A day of poor visibility with light rain falling as snow above 950 metres. The freezing level was around 1100 metres. Winds were strong and mainly from the East-South-East.\nObservedSnowStability: Isolated shallow accumulations of windslab can be found on South-West, West and North-West aspects above 1000 metres. Outwith these areas the snowpack is moist and consolidated in most locations, with a widespread soft crust. Cornices are present above Northerly aspects around coire rims. The avalanche hazard is Low."
