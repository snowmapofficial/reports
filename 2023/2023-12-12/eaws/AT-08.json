The snowpack at intermediate altitudes is thoroughly wet down to the ground, thereby weakened. Many wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches were the result. Further gliding movement of the wet snowpack can be expected in steep zones which have not yet discharged. As temperatures drop, the snowpack cannot consolidate.

        "comment": "Above 2000 m avalanche danger is considerable. Main problem at high altitudes: fresh snow and freshly generated snowdrift accumulations. Danger zones occur in steep wind-loaded terrain and behind protruberances. Even large-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Also naturally triggered avalanches are possible. More deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack can usually be triggered only by large additional loading, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls. In zones where there is rain impact, glide-snow avalanches can be expected in steep terrain, on grassy slopes of all aspects where the snow has not yet discharged. At 1500-2000 m these can grow to large size. Caution urged below glide cracks. Backcountry tours require much caution and self-restraint. ",
