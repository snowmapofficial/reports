        "SnowDistribution": "No visibility throughout the day above 600 metres. Wet snowpack at lower elevations.",
        "Comment": "Snow amounts are uncertain, with the greatest amounts expected in the Northern Cairngorms.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight snow, falling above 800 metres is expected, followed by a dry day. Winds will be very strong and from the East-North-East overnight, decreasing to become fresh from the South-East by midday. The freezing level is expected to be around 800 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Windslab will be deposited overnight on steep South, through South-West to North-West aspects above 850 metres. Isolated deposits will be most sensitive at higher elevations where they achieve depth in very steep terrain, such as gully tops, coire rims and convexities. Outwith these areas the snowpack will be stable in most locations. Fragile cornices will continue to build. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A day of poor visibility with light rain falling as snow above 950 metres. The freezing level was around 1100 metres. Winds were strong and mainly from the East-South-East.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Isolated shallow accumulations of windslab can be found on South-West, West and North-West aspects above 1000 metres. Outwith these areas the snowpack is moist and consolidated in most locations, with a widespread soft crust. Cornices are present above Northerly aspects around coire rims. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
