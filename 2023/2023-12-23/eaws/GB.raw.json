        "WeatherInfluences": "Light rain during the early evening, easing to give a dry night. Light precipitation arriving by morning, falling as snow above 1050 metres. Strong, generally Westerly winds.  Freezing level lowering from above the summits to 1100 metres by morning.",
        "SnowStability": "The thin wet snow will start to firm up, becoming icy above 1100 metres. Below this altitude the patchy snow will remain soft and wet. Localised areas of deeper snow will be encountered in wind sheltered locations on East to South aspects above 900 metres but stability will be good.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Thin wet snow to glen level, rapidly thawing during the day. Pockets of deeper snow are present on East to South aspects above 900 metres but distribution is limited. Stability is generally good with only the steepest of terrain displaying minor surface instability.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "During the day isolated areas of fresh windslab will build on North through East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres.  The greatest instabilities will be where these fresh accumulations have gained greatest depth such as gully tops and coire rims and will generally be easily avoidable.  Fragile cornices will start to build on these aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The fresh snowpack continues to consolidate and thaw in the mild temperatures.  This moist snowpack is mainly sitting on bare ground or on top of old stable snow patches.  Greatest accumulations can be found in North and East facing coires above 950 metres in steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire rims.   The avalanche hazard is Low.",
