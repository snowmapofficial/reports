        "comment": "Some fresh snow overnight in the northern barrier cloud regions (10 cm from Dachstein over northern Niedere Tauern to M\u00fcrzsteg Alps possible). Snowfall level: 1000-1200 m. Elsewhere the precipitation will be minor, tomorrow it will slacken off everywhere as much warmer air masses move in (zero-debrees level ascending to 2200-2500 m by evening, even higher in the south). Minor precipitation, later turning to rainfall. Tonight the gale-strength NW winds will shift to a westerly airstream and slowly recede but still reach windspeeds of 80 km/hr in the Northern Alps, even more in early morning."
