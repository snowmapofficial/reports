Danger zones occur in steep wind-loaded terrain on N/E/S facing slopes, near to and distant from ridges, at forest edges and in trenches, gullies, bowls. In many places avalanches can be triggered by 1 person, and reach medium size.\r\nIn addition, gliding snow activity is increasing. Glide-snow avalanches can release at any time of day on very steep smooth slopes naturally, at all altitudes and in all aspects. Avalanches tend to remain small. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",
