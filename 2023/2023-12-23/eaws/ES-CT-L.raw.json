      "comment" : "The avalanche conditions in the morning, after a clear night, are favourable. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> <br/> Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. In particular steep shady slopes: In many places there is a danger of falling on the icy crust."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "As a consequence of falling temperatures, rain up to high altitudes and the moderate to strong wind, a crust formed on the surface on Friday. On Sunday it will be sunny. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack on very steep sunny slopes. At high altitude there are 30 to 50 cm of snow. In all regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
