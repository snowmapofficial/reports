Danger zones increase in size and frequency with ascending altitude, occurring primarily on wind-loaded steep slopes and in ridgeline terrain. They are often difficult to recognize. A small-to-medium slab avalanche can be triggered by 1 person. At all altitudes in steep terrain and on smooth grass-covered slopes in all aspects, glide-snow avalanches are possible which can reach medium size. Caution in zones below glide cracks. At low altitudes, wet slides are possible.",

        "comment": "The fresh fallen snow has been able to settle and stabilize. At low altitudes the snowpack is wet, has forfeited its firmness. Primarily in ridgline terrain and exposed zones, intermittently moderate-strength winds have transported the fresh snow and generated new snowdrift accumulations.  Wherever they blanket the fresh snow of soft layers or surface hoar, they are prone to triggering. Older snowdrifts are being increasingly blanketed over. At low and intermediate altitudes the base often is moist atop a warm ground, which favours gliding snow. There is currently little data available to the Avalanche Warning Service about the snowpack in various regions."

Danger zones occur in steep wind-loaded terrain and ridgelines and increase in size and frequency with ascending altitude. A medium slab avalanche can be triggered by 1 person. More deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack can usually be triggered only be large additional loading, primarily in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls. At all altitudes in steep terrain and on smooth grass-covered slopes in all aspects, glide-snow avalanches are possible which can reach medium size. Caution in zones below glide cracks.
