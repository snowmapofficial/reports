Danger zones occur with the freshly generated snowdrift accumulations, esp. in extended S/E facing terrain, where 1 person can trigger an avalanche. At low and intermediate altitudes, naturally triggered wet-snow and loose-snow avalanches are still possible in all aspects on steep slopes, but decrease as temperatures drop. On very steep grass-covered slopes or smooth rock surfaces glide-snow avalanches can still be expected where snow depths permit.",

Above that altitude the fresh snow was deposited atop a melt-freeze encrusted surface, the bonding is poorer. With moderate to storm-strength NW winds, new snowdrifts will accumulate, depositing patches on S/E facing slopes, their proneness to triggering increases with ascending altitude. At intermediate and low altitudes, the snowpack is already moist/wet down to the ground and can glide away naturally at any time of day. Likelihood of this decreases as temperatures drop."
