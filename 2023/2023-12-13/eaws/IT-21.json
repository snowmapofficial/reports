In the last few days sometimes easily released wind slabs formed at elevated altitudes. Single backcountry tourers can release avalanches, including medium-sized ones. In some places avalanches can also penetrate down to the ground and reach large size in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for caution and restraint.",
