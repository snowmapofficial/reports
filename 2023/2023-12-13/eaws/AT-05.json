Above 2000 m the fresh snowdrifts esp. on N/S facing slopes are prone to treiggering. Avalanches in many places can be triggered by 1 person and reach medium size. Danger zones increase with ascending altitude, often unrecognizable due to poor visibility.\r\nAbove 2500 m, weak layers in the old snowpack can be triggered. Danger zones esp. on shady very steep slopes. Transitions from shallow to deeper snow are unfavourable. Releases usually require large additional loading but can fracture down to deeper layers and then grow to large size.\r\nBelow 2200 m the gliding snow activity will persist. Danger zones occur in all aspects. Glide-snow avalanches can release on steep grassy slopes and smooth rocky ground at any time of day and reach medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",
