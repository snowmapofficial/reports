They are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack. <br/> The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In the neighbouring regions and at intermediate and high altitudes the likelihood of avalanches is higher. <br/> In the morning and where less new snow falls, the danger of falling on hard snow remains, so it is advisable to carry snow knives and crampons for the steeper sections.",
