        "comment": "Avalanche danger in the Bavarian Alps is low. Gliding snow is the main problem. On very steep slopes with smooth ground  in all aspects, isolated naturally triggered glide-snow releases (small-to-medium) are possible. Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger.\r\nApart from that, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations can trigger a small slab even by minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur above the timberline near near ridges on north and east-facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude. Danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow from avalanches.",

Only small amounts of fresh snow are being transported by westerly winds in exposed terrain, generating small, often trigger-sensitive drifts on leeward slopes. Backcountry tours usually require passages where skis must be carried."
