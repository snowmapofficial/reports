The new snow and wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant. Wind slabs are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. They are covered with new snow and are difficult to recognise. In particular on very steep shady slopes the avalanches can be released in the various wind slab layers and reach large size.",
