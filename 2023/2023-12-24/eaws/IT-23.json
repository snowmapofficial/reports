Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. Caution is to be exercised on steep shady slopes. At transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. <br/> The weather will be mild. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day. This applies in particular in steep rocky terrain, and at the base of rock walls. <br/>",
