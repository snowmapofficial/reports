        "comment": "The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on shady slopes above approximately 1800 m. In particular on steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain small and medium-sized slab avalanches are possible. At elevated altitudes the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. <br/> Several small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation.",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs of the last few days represent the main danger. The weather will be mild."
