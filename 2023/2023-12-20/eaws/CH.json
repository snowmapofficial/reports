The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Avalanches can be released by a single winter sport participant, but they will be small in most cases. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. In very isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> Careful route selection is advisable.",

This is unfavourable in view of the upcoming snowfall. With new fallen snow and increasing wind, fresh snowdrift accumulations are continuing to grow, especially on the northern flank of the Alps. They are prone to triggering.</p><p>Deeper in the snowpack, there are sometimes weak layers in the area of older rain crusts. However, these are often so deep in the snowpack that they are unlikely to be released by people. In southern Upper Valais, Ticino, Moesano, Val Bregaglia and Val Poschiavo, older weak layers are less covered and may occasionally be released by people.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially below 2400 m.

The avalanche danger will increase rapidly and significantly on Friday with heavy snowfall and stormy weather, reaching danger level 4 (high) widely on the Northern Alpine Ridge, in northern Grisons and in the Lower Engadine north of the Inn. An increase to danger level 4 (high) is also possible in Lower Valais and in other parts of Grisons. Many naturally triggered avalanches are to be expected. As the day progresses, some very large avalanches are increasingly to be expected, especially in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. Exposed parts of transportation routes will be at risk.</p><p>The avalanche danger will also increase in the other regions.
