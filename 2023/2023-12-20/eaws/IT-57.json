The avalanche prone locations are to be found at elevated altitudes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard crust.",

They are very small and unlikely to be released now. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be severely restricted. These weather conditions will give rise to softening of the old snowpack."
