        "comment": "As a consequence of falling temperatures and low relative humidity a crust will form on the surface during the night. These conditions will foster a substantial stabilisation of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 20 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
