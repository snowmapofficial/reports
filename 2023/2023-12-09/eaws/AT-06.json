Danger zones primarikly on N/E facing slopes behind protruberances and at entries into gullies, bowls where slab avalanches can trigger even from 1 person. At intermediate and low altitudes the higher temperatures and rain impact has caused the snowpack to forfeit its firmness, likelihood of glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches is higher. Danger zones are steep grassy slopes and steep hillsides.",
