      "comment" : "The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on northeast to south to southwest facing aspects above approximately 2000 m. In isolated cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in places that are protected from the wind. <br/> From midday as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist snow slides. The avalanches in these loacations are rather small. <br/> The conditions are sometimes unfavourable for ski touring, freeriding and snowshoe hiking in steep terrain."

      "comment" : "30 to 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last few days above approximately 1800 m. The wind was strong to storm force adjacent to ridgelines. Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 50 cm of snow. <br/> The wind slabs are lying on a crust in all aspects. <br/> In all regions at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
