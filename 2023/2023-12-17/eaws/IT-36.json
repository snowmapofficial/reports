        "comment": "As a consequence of warming, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in all regions. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The small wind slabs of the last few days can be released, especially by large additional loads,.",
        "highlights": "The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality. <br/> The wind slabs of the last few days represent the main danger."
