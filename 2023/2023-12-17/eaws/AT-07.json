        "comment": "The no longer entirely fresh wind slabs are in some cases still prone to triggering above approximately 2400 m. Wind slabs can in some places be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep shady slopes. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in very isolated cases in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. The avalanche prone locations are rare but are barely recognisable. <br/> <br/> In addition as the day progresses on south facing slopes, further mostly small loose snow avalanches are possible. In the regions with a lot of snow individual gliding avalanches are possible.",
