Fresh South-Westerly winds, increasing to strong Westerlies during the afternoon. Freezing level remaining above the summits, eventually lowering to around 1300 metres, late in the period.",
        "SnowStability": "Very little change expected with the patchy snow continuing to thaw. The rate of thaw will slow as the freezing level lowers. Largest areas of snow will be found on the higher summits, with only small patches present on the sub 950 metre tops. The snow will be well bonded and stable.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Mild with light rain and strong winds. Freezing level well above the summits with plus 6.1 degrees centigrade recorded at 930 metres at midday.",

The remaining snow is soft with wet surface layers, but is generally well bonded and stable.  Greatest hazard is presented by rock fall, due to thawing ice and receding snow.
