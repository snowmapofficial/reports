        "SnowDistribution": "No snow below 650m thin blanket of snow above.  Clear on the tops early morning, cloudy from late morning.  Winds approx 10mph or less.",
        "Comment": "A deepening depression will bring widespread heavy snow northwards through Wednesday, accompanied by strong to gale force North Easterly winds leading to blizzards for a time.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Moderate North-Easterly winds back through North to West and increase to Strong overnight before easing and backing West-South-West by the end of the day. Light snow showers expected late evening and during Tuesday morning. The freezing level will be around 500-600 meters.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated pockets of fresh windslab will develop on mostly East through South to Westerly aspects above 800 meters. These accumulations are expected to be shallow and will be confined to gully tops and corrie rims. Elsewhere, the new snow will lie on bare, wet ground and present no significant hazard. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Old snow patches lying on North-East to South-East aspects above 800 metres have refrozen and are hard, icy and stable. These are overlain with a covering of shallow new snow, which is generally well bonded and stable. On all aspects there is a superficial covering of new snow which overlays bare, wet ground and presents no hazard. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
