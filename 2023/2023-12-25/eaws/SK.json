In the higher altitudes (High and Western Tatras) there is still loose unbound snow, which is and will continue to be transported to the leeward slopes of the southern, south-eastern and eastern exposures due to strong north-west winds. In such places, especially in narrow and steep couloirs, slopes on the leeward sides of ridges, it is possible to release an avalanche with only a small additional load.  Another problem is wet snow. Ongoing warming, which will continue through Tuesday, will cause the 0\u00b0C isotherm to reach its highest levels later in the day.  Spontaneous basement avalanches from wet snow are possible during the day, especially on prominent avalanche slopes of all exposures.",

There is still dry snow at the highest altitudes, which has been transported by strong winds to the leeward sides of the ridges, where it is stored in unstable slabs and cushions. Warming will continue to persist through Tuesday, including at the highest altitudes, so we expect a further decrease in snow cover. At mid-elevations, the snowpack is soaked throughout the profile, and we expect gradual soaking at the highest elevations during the day!"

Unlike other mountain ranges, this region did not experience such significant snowfall during the last snowfall period. Wet snow is the main avalanche problem due to persistent warming. Therefore, slopes with a large collecting area and sufficient snow cover are dangerous, especially significant avalanche paths of all exposures. In these positions, especially on steep slopes, avalanche release from wet snow is possible.",
