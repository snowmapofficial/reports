        "comment": "The more recent wind slabs can be released, especially by large additional loads, in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. On steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain small and medium-sized slab avalanches are possible. <br/> Several small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation.",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs of the last few days represent the main danger. The weather will be mild."
