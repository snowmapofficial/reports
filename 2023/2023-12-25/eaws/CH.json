There are large, often compact and hard wind slabs (accumulations of snow) at a distance from ridgelines. The surface of the snowpack is also often brittle. The snowpack structure is generally favourable. Exceptions are, on the one hand, slopes that are highly protected from the wind, where new snow and snowdrift from the past week are lying on top of a loose surface of old snow with faceted grains and, on the other hand, weak layers around the crusts from November, where these are only thinly covered. Dry slab avalanches, which may become larger, are most likely to be released in these areas.</p><p>As a consequence of daytime warming and incoming radiation, moist snow slides from the rocks are possible on steep south-facing slopes. The activity of gliding avalanches is increasing, especially on steep south-facing slopes. However, these are also possible in the other aspects.</p>"
