This could happen again on Monday.  <br/>  At high altitudes, there is about twice as much snow as there normally is at the beginning of December. The snowpack has a favourable structure, apart from thin weak layers of angular crystals deep in the snowpack in the area of older rain crusts. With all the new snow and intense rain, these weak layers could be reactivated in the next few days. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface. Especially there, the older weak layers can also be released by people in some cases.  <br/>  In all regions and in all aspects, more gliding avalanches are expected below about 2400 m on slippery ground.</p>"

It will not change significantly on Wednesday. Below 2000 to 2400 m, some large, wet avalanches are expected. Dry avalanches are expected from starting zones at higher altitudes, which will sweep along the increasingly saturated old snowpack in their path and advance into the valleys in the usual avalanche tracks. These avalanches can become very large and exposed parts of transportation routes are at risk.

This could happen again on Monday.  <br/>  At high altitudes, there is about twice as much snow as there normally is at the beginning of December. The snowpack has a favourable structure, apart from thin weak layers of angular crystals deep in the snowpack in the area of older rain crusts. With all the new snow and intense rain, these weak layers could be reactivated in the next few days. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface. Especially there, the older weak layers can also be released by people in some cases.  <br/>  In all regions and in all aspects, more gliding avalanches are expected below about 2400 m on slippery ground.</p>"

The snowpack has a favourable structure, apart from thin weak layers of angular crystals deep in the snowpack in the area of older rain crusts. With all the new snow and intense rain, these weak layers could be reactivated in the next few days. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface.

With all the new snow and intense rain, these weak layers could be reactivated in the next few days.
