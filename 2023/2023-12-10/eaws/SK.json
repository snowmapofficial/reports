Winds are gusting, creating wind-rolled slabs and cushions just below ridges, in leeward bulges and troughs, which are not connected to the hard ground. They can be released with only a small additional load on slopes mainly above 40\u00b0. Small wet avalanches may occur in the forest zone due to warming from loose wet snow from the last snowfall.",

These are most pronounced just below the ridges on all orientations as winds of variable directions have been creating them over the last few days."
