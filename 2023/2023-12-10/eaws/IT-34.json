        "comment": "The fresh wind slabs represent the main danger. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily by a single winter sport participant in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence above approximately 2200 m. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m small to medium-sized moist avalanches are possible. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection.",
        "highlights": "Until the afternoon the wind will be moderate to strong. The fresh wind slabs represent the main danger. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude."
