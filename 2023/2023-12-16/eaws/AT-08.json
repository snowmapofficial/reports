        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. Fresh snow and with ascending altitude increasingly large snowdrift accumulations can trigger a small-to-medium slab avalanche. Danger zones occur on steep ridgeline slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow, also the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall need to be considered. More loose-snow avalanches can be expected due to higher temperatures. In steep terrain, forest lands and on grassy slopes, glide-snow avalanches can be expected in all aspects, reaching small-to-medium size. At low altitudes the snowpack has deteriorated.",

        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. Main problem: older snowdrifts. Danger zones occur in steep wind-loaded terrain and behind protruberances, as well as in gullies and bowls, increasingly frequent with ascending altitude. Blanketed drifts are hard to recognize. Slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Lower layers in the snowpack can be triggered mostly by large additional loading, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. entries into gullies and bowls. Below 2400 m glide-snow avalanches can be expected in extremely steep terrain, forest lanes and on smooth grassy slopes which have not yet discharged, becoming large with ascending altitude. Exposed zones can be placed at risk thereby. Caution below glide cracks. Increasing loose-snow avalanches are possible during the day. ",
