        "comment": "The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on northeast to south to southwest facing aspects above approximately 2000 m. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and can be released easily in some cases by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in places that are protected from the wind. <br/> From midday as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep grassy slopes below approximately 2300 m. The avalanches in these loacations are rather small. <br/> The conditions are sometimes unfavourable for ski touring, freeriding and snowshoe hiking in steep terrain.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs and wet snow represent the main danger."
