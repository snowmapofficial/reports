This applies on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2400 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible. <br/> <br/> The somewhat older wind slabs are in individual cases still prone to triggering especially on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m.

Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released especially by large additional loads in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. These places are very rare but are difficult to recognise.
