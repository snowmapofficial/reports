        "comment": "The avalanche conditions in the morning, after a clear night, are generally favourable. In particular very steep sunny slopes: As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist snow slides. These can be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. <br/> <br/> The clearly visible wind slabs of last week can still be released in some cases in particular on wind-protected shady slopes and generally at high altitude. In isolated cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized.",
