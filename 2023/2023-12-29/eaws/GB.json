On Saturday, a warm front brings new snow and South-Easterly gales with the freezing level rising to around 750 metres.\nObserved Weather Influences: It was calm and almost windless, clear skies with a bonus of some sunshine.  More snow arrived last night mainly above 650 metres, also a slight frost in the glens gave some icy paths. Today was colder than of late with very light Westerly winds the freezing level was around 500 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Instabilities remain in deeper accumulations of mainly localised deposits of poorly bonded windslab. Areas most affect are on North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres on steeper slopes, in sheltered gullies and on coire headwalls. Cornices on similar aspects are also fragile.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate."

Winds will be fresh and from the West-North-West initially, increasing to storm force and veering South-Easterly during the day.  The freezing level will be around 500 metres rising to 900 metres later.\nObserved Weather Influences: Overnight rain fell at all elevations. Following this the day was dry with strong winds from the West-North-West. The freezing level was at around 500 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack is generally stable with a surface rain crust at all elevations. Isolated drifts of fresh snow are covered by this crust on North-East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres and are mostly soft but stable. Outwith these areas the ground is icy and scoured where exposed to the wind. The avalanche hazard is Low."
