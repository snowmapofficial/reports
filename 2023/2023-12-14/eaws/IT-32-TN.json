In some cases avalanches are medium-sized and can be released even by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places even by individual winter sport participants especially at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. This applies in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes in particular above approximately 2400 m. These avalanche prone locations are rather rare and are difficult to recognise.",
