        "comment": "The wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized and can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in places that are protected from the wind. <br/> From midday as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be an increase in the danger of gliding avalanches and snow slides. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep grassy slopes below approximately 2300 m. The avalanches in these loacations are rather small. <br/> The conditions are treacherous for ski touring, freeriding and snowshoe hiking.",
