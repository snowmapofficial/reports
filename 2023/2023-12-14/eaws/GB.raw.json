        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack at lower altitudes, a surface crust developing at mid mountain, dry snowpack at the highest levels.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells.  Winds 30-40 mph, progress difficult and tiring in wind exposed terrain.",
        "Comment": "Mild unsettled conditions expected for the next few days.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions followed by rain at all levels during the afternoon.  Winds will be strong West-South-Westerly, increasing gale to storm force later in the day.   The 1100 metre freezing level will rise to above the summits by mid morning.",
        "SnowStability": "Accumulations of unstable windslab will remain on North-West through North to Easterly aspects above 1000 metres.  The greatest instability will be in steep and convex locations such as below coire rims, gully exits and crag aprons.  On these aspects cornices will become increasingly unstable especially during the afternoon.  Elsewhere the snowpack will be generally well bonded stable.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Occasional showers falling as snow at summit levels.  Winds were strong Westerly in direction. The freezing level was around 1100 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "New accumulations of moderately bonded windslab have developed on North-West through North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres.  The greatest instability is above 1000 metres in steep wind sheltered locations, such as below coire rims, gully exits and crag aprons.  Unstable cornices overhang these aspects.  Elsewhere the snowpack is mostly stable.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
