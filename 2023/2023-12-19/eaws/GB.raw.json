        "SnowDistribution": "Icy patches on paths and hillsides.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells.  Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Old snow firm and icy today. Staying unsettled. Thawing on  Wednesday, turning colder on Thursday night.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Limited overnight snowfall above 600 metres, turning to light rain during the day, as the freezing level rises over the summits. Winds will be fresh, mostly West-North-Westerly.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be a trace of fresh snow above 600 metres which will rapidly thaw as the freezing level rises above the summits by mid-morning. The old patches of snow will start to soften but will remain well bonded and stable. These patches will be found in mainly wind sheltered locations on North-West through North to East aspects above 950 metres.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "There was a return to cooler conditions during the early hours of the morning. After a bright start, cloud pushed in with a trace of snow falling. Winds were fresh to strong, generally Westerly.",

        "Comment": "Older snow patches have re-frozen, are very firm with serious runouts. \r\nThe greatest forecast snow amounts are likely to be on the Western periphery of the Northern Cairngorms forecast area.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation falling as snow overnight to around 700 metres will ease around dawn, later becoming very light rain showers at all levels. The winds will be gale, occasionally storm force Westerlies. Freezing levels will be around 800 metres overnight rising during the morning to be above the highest summits by the end of the forecast period.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated accumulations of windslab will develop on steep, wind sheltered North through East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres. Coire rims and gully tops will only be affected where moderately bonded accumulations overlie the existing snowpack or achieve depth. Outwith these areas a light dusting of snow will cover bare ground. Cornices will develop around coire rims. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The older, patchy snow cover has re-frozen in the colder temperatures. Isolated and shallow fresh windslab has developed in steep, wind sheltered locations on North through East to South East aspects above 1000 metres. At lower altitudes and on other aspects a dusting of new snow overlies bare ground to around 700 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
