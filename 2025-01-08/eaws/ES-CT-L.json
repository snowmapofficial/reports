        "comment": "The soft wind slabs of the last few days are lying on a crust in particular on shady slopes. The avalanches can sometimes be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2000 m and at transitions into gullies and bowls. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated small moist loose snow slides are possible in all altitude zones.",

As a consequence of the moderate to strong westerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. The snowpack is favourably layered and its surface has a strong melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 80 cm of snow. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
