Snowdrifts can be triggered by one single skier. Avalanches can in isolated cases trigger naturally at the foot of rock cliffs and grow to medium size esp in zones where snowfall has been heavy. They can also trigger in the weak layers in isolated cases and grow to medium size. Particularly unfavorable are shady slopes. Size and frequency of danger zones will tend to increase with ascending altitude."
