This thin old snowpack was particularly present in gullies and bowls on western, northern and eastern slopes above 2200 m. Here, avalanches can easily be triggered.</li><li>In the inneralpine regions of Valais and Grisons, there are distinct weak layers in the snowpack at high altitude. In these, avalanches can be triggered in places and sometimes tear through to the ground.</li><li>North of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine and in the extreme west of Lower Valais, the snowpack structure is more favourable. Avalanches in weak layers in the old snowpack are only possible in isolated cases.</li></ul>"
