The surface of the snowpack cooled hardly at all during the overcast night. <br/> The rain will give rise as the day progresses to rapid moistening of the snowpack at low and intermediate altitudes. 10 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until the evening above approximately 1800 m. <br/> At intermediate and high altitudes there is still a very large amount of snow."
