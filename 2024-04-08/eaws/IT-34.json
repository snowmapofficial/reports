        "comment": "Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be reduced. The avalanche danger will increase but remain within the current danger level. Backcountry tours should be started and concluded early. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation moist and wet avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses. This applies in particular on very steep slopes above approximately 1900 m, as well as at the base of rock walls. Occasionally large natural avalanches are not ruled out. The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence at high altitude. These places are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Backcountry tourers or freeriders can release avalanches. In particular on shady slopes the avalanches can penetrate even deep layers.",
