        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. Continuing wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches are possible in the morning, esp. on sunny slopes but also on shady slopes, they can become medium-sized, even large-sized, if avalanches fracture down to more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack Backcountry tours and ascents up to huts should be terminated early in the day. In high-alpine regions the danger of dry-snow avalanches in the morning is low, later rising with fresh snow and winds. Esp. in ridgeline terrain and wind-loaded gullies and bowls, fresh drifts are prone to triggering and easily released. Cornices can still break or collapse.",
