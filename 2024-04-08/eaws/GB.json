The freezing level will be around 800 metres. Light Northerly winds will back to become North-Westerly and strengthen to gale force.\nObserved Weather Influences: Strong South-Westerly winds eased slightly through the day. It remained dry with some long sunny spells. The freezing level was around 900 metres overnight rising above the summits during the day.\nObservedSnowStability: The snowpack firmed up overnight. The surface then softened through the day, particularly in locations exposed to the sunshine. Stability remains good in all locations. The avalanche hazard is Low."
