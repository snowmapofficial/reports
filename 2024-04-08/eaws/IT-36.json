        "comment": "As a consequence of solar radiation the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Gliding avalanches can also occur, in particular on steep grassy slopes. <br/> The wind slabs remain for the foreseeable future prone to triggering, especially adjacent to ridgelines. In all regions medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large avalanches are possible. <br/> Avalanches can be released, mostly by large loads.",
