        "comment": "The avalanche risk is assessed as low. The cold preserves the snowdrift accumulations. The snowdrift accumulations above around 2000 m are still prone to disruption and are mainly located in gullies and bowls that have been blown in as well as behind broad ridges and ridgelines with a northern or eastern aspect. In a few places, the wind slab can be triggered by individuals as a small slab avalanche. However, the avalanche prone locations are easily recognisable. In addition to the risk of burial in terrain traps, the risk of being swept away and falling must also be taken into account.",
