In the higher altitudes, small to maximum medium-sized snow slabs can still be triggered in a few places by low additional loads in the wind slab. The frequency and extent of the danger zones increase slightly with altitude. The danger zones are located adjacent to the ridgeline and also behind terrain edges far from the ridge as well as in steep gullies and bowls. In shady slopes at high and high alpine altitudes, small to medium-sized avalanches in persistent weak layers are still possible in isolated cases.",
