      "comment" : "On Wednesday, visibility will often be limited by dense clouds, with light and unproductive snowfall in places. The afternoon will bring a few clear spells, but the sky will only clear more frequently towards the evening. The wind will be mostly weak from westerly directions, moderately strong from the north-east in the high alpine regions. Temperatures at 1500 m around -12 degrees, at 2000 m -15 degrees.\nThursday will be very cloudy with some new fallen snow. The wind will pick up from the west and become moderate, even stronger in exposed areas. The temperature will rise from -11 to -4 degrees in 1500 metres and from -15 to -6 degrees in 2000 metres during the daytime changes."

      "highlights" : "Few avalanche prone locations in the high altitudes!",
      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is predominantly low. Attention should be paid to localised avalanche prone locations in the steep terrain adjacent to the ridgeline, as well as in filled-in bowls and gullies. Here, only small slab avalanches could be triggered in a few places in the terrain by low additional loads. Avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise and should be avoided."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Due to the very cold temperatures, older snowdrift accumulations are still present at high altitudes. They may contain thin intermediate layers and often lie on angular forms or on a hardness of old snowpack. The thin snow base, fundament is weakened by the kinetic metamorphism. The snow depths are very below average even at high altitudes."
