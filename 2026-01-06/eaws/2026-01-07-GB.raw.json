        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds will be mainly North-North-Westerly, gale force overnight then gradually easing through the day. Overnight the freezing level will drop from 500 metres to be around 300 metres through the day. Precipitation is expected throughout the period, initially falling as snow above 400 metres, then above 200 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "New unstable windslab will be deposited in wind sheltered areas, mainly on East through South to South-West aspects above 700 metres, where avalanches are likely. Fragile cornices will continue to build above these aspects. Weaknesses will persist in the recently deposited windslab lying mainly on North through East to South-East aspects above 700 metres. Weaknesses will also remain in deeper deposits of windslab at lower levels. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

Accumulations of unstable windslab will form in wind sheltered locations on mainly North-East through East to South aspects above 850 metres. The greatest hazard will be where these accumulations build on the localised areas of old frozen snow, typically sheltered hollows, coire rims, ridge flanks, gullies and gully tops. Cornices will be prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Deeper accumulations and drifting, with poorly bonded windslab has formed on North through East to South-East aspects above 850 metres. The greatest hazard is where these accumulations have formed on the localised areas of old frozen snow, around coire rims, ridge flanks, gullies and gully tops. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
