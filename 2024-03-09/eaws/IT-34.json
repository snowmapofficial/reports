        "comment": "Above approximately 1200 m snow will fall on Sunday over a wide area. In some localities 40 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 2000 m. In particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation and on steep slopes medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large loose snow avalanches are possible as a consequence of the new snow. The new snow and wind slabs can be released easily in all aspects above the tree line. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. As a consequence of the rain, the likelihood of gliding avalanches and snow slides being released will increase on very steep slopes below approximately 1400 m.",
        "highlights": "The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger."

The fresh wind slabs will be deposited on soft layers in particular on northwest to north to northeast facing aspects above approximately 2500 m. The fresh wind slabs are to be assessed with care and prudence. In particular slopes adjacent to ridgelines are especially precarious."
