Snow will continue to drift during Saturday night into Sunday.</p><p>A lot of new snow is expected on and to the south of the Main Alpine Ridge; this snow will drift significantly.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places. However, around the crusts in the upper third of the old snowpack, layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure are deposited, in which, especially in the inneralpine regions of Grisons above around 2400 m, avalanches were released in the week that is coming to an end.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes.
