As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong wind from southerly directions, sometimes avalanche prone wind slabs will form. <br/> Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released by individual winter sport participants. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above the tree line. Places where surface hoar has been covered with snow are especially unfavourable. In particular in regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 4 (high) and in high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is greater. <br/> Avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size. Great caution and restraint are required. <br/> In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists, in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. These can reach quite a large size. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible."

As a consequence of the moderate to strong wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form. Fresh wind slabs are lying on soft layers at elevated altitudes. They are very prone to triggering. <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the top section of the old snowpack on west, north and east facing slopes. This applies above approximately 2400 m."
