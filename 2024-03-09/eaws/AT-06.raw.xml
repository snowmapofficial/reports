          <avActivityHighlights>Low avalanche danger, isolated fresh snowdrifts at high altitudes</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger is low in general. The small amount of fresh snow covers isolated danger zones on steep north-facing slopes above 1700 m, where large additional loading could trigger small slab avalanches. In steep terrain, however, the danger of taking a fall outweighs that of snow masses. The danger of isolated naturally triggered glide-snow slides on very steep, esp. south-facing slopes above 1900 m is receding.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>The snowpack base is stable by and large, but moist at the base, tending to glide over smooth ground. During the last three days in most regions, there has been 5-10 cm of fresh snow registered, deposited in all aspects atop a melt-freeze encrusted snowpack surface. The fresh snowdrifts are not relevant to avalanche danger, but are bonding poorly with the snowpack surface. On Sunday, a bit of fresh snowfall is expected; esp. on north-facing slopes above 1700 m, isolated older weak layers in the old snow and in transitions from fresh to old snow can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>A stormy southerly foehn air current is determining the weather in Styria. In early morning on Sunday, clouds from the south will shroud the peaks, light snowfall is possible from Turrach to Koralpe, rainfall below 1500 m. On the northern flank of the Alps and in the furthermost eastern regions, southerly foehn winds will disperse the clouds, but as of midday cloud cover will again move in. By evening a perturbance from the south will bring rainfall and snowfall to the land, storm-strength southerly winds which can reach gale strength on the eastern rim of the Alps, and in Hochschwab, Veitsch, Wechsel and Rax. At 2000 m: 0 degrees; at 1500 m: +4 degrees.&#13;
On Monday, variably cloudy, intermittently dispersing clouds alternating with sunshine. But rain showers will soon arrive, spreading and becoming more frequent in the afternoon. Snowfall level at 1700 m. Temperatures dropping slightly, winds shifting to northwest.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>Avalanche danger levels are not expected to change significantly.</tendencyComment>
