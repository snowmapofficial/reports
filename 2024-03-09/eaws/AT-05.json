        "comment": "Due to intensifying southerly foehn wind, fresh snowdrift accumulations are still being generated. Above 2000 m on shady slopes there is 10 cm of loose snow atop a melt-freeze crust generally capable of bearing loads. Below this and on sunny slopes at all altitudes the fresh snow from Wednesday is already moist and has formed a new crust. At intermediate altitudes the snowpack has become moist repeated times and is very compact. Below 1400 m there is hardly any snow on the ground."
