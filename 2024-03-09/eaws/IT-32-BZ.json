        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force southerly wind, avalanche prone wind slabs will form. These will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. The fresh wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in all aspects above the tree line. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> In addition a certain danger of gliding avalanches exists, in particular on steep sunny slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. These can in isolated cases reach medium size. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
