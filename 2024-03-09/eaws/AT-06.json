The small amount of fresh snow covers isolated danger zones on steep north-facing slopes above 1700 m, where large additional loading could trigger small slab avalanches. In steep terrain, however, the danger of taking a fall outweighs that of snow masses. The danger of isolated naturally triggered glide-snow slides on very steep, esp. south-facing slopes above 1900 m is receding.",
