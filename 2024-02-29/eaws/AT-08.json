Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls. Activities in backcountry demand experience in outlying terrain and the ability to assess avalanche dangers on-site, as well as a cautious route selection. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger below 2600 m at any time of day or night and reach large size. Caution urged below glide cracks. Due to rain immpact, only small-sized wet loose-snow avalanches can be expected.",
