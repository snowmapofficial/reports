Numerous large natural avalanches are possible, also in all aspects on steep slopes. In avalanche paths that are already filled with snow they can to an increasing extent reach the valleys. <br/> The avalanches can occur again, even in paths where avalanches have already been released. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation, avalanche activity has already peaked. <br/> Dry avalanches can over a wide area be released, even by a single winter sport participant and reach large size in isolated cases.",
