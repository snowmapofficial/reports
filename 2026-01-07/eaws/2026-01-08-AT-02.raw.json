The fresh and older wind slabs can be released easily in many places. <br/> <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on southwest to north to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2200 m and on steep south facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"5 to 15 cm of snow will fall.
