Fresh snowdrift accumulations in the north, east and south sectors, mainly behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls, can sometimes be triggered as small to medium slab avalanches due to low additional loads. In addition to the risk of burial in terrain traps, the risk of being swept away and falling must also be taken into account."
