        "comment": "Due to the cold temperatures, older snowdrift accumulations are still present at high altitudes. These can contain thin intermediate layers and often lie on angular forms or on a superficially hard old snowpack. There are only a few centimetres of new fallen snow, which is being transported somewhat in the higher elevations by strong west to north-westerly winds. The thin snow base, fundament is weakened by the kinetic metamorphism. The snow depths are very below average, even at high altitudes."

Temperatures at 1500 m -7 degrees, at 2000 m -12 degrees at midday.\n\nOn Friday, visibility will often be limited by dense clouds and it will snow at times, especially in the morning. On the northern edge of the Alps, the snowfall level may temporarily rise to over 1000 metres. The afternoon will bring only a little precipitation and a few clear spells will improve visibility at times. Moderate, in some cases brisk westerly winds in the high alpine regions. Temperatures at 1500 m -2 degrees, at 2000 m -5 degrees."
