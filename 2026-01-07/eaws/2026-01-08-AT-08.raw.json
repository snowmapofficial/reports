Frequency and spread of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude and as the day proceeds. In addition, isolated avalanches can be releases in high alpine regions on very steep shady slopes in the weak old snow. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and being forced to take a fall also require caution."
