Fresh and older snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as small or medium slab avalanches by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations are located adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit in steep terrain in northern and eastern aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The number and extent of avalanche prone locations increase with the onset of the storm from midday onwards. Southern slopes must then also be assessed more carefully. In addition to the risk of burial, the risk of being swept away and falling must be taken into account."

Older wind slabs are sometimes still prone to triggering on old surface hoar. Below a melt-freeze crust close to the surface, faceted crystals can often be found right down to the ground, especially at higher altitudes. There is little snow on the south side."
