        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow at all altitudes - very hard going on foot.  Main cloud base initially at 600 metres, before rising 800 to 900 metres briefly. Light winds.",
        "Comment": "Expect drifting of lying soft snow over the next 24 hours.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Some light snow showers expected throughout the forecast period. Light winds from the South will increase overnight to become fresh to strong South-South-Westerly, before easing through the afternoon. The 400 metre freezing level  will rise to 500 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be a redistribution of lying snow with avalanches likely on North-West to North-East aspects mainly above 900m. Cross loading will affect West and East aspects.  Snowpack weaknesses will persist in many other areas and in particular East to South aspects above 900 metres.  On these aspects localised instabilities will affect steep banks and burn lines below 900m. Cornices will be fragile.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Snowfall turned to light showers during the day. Moderate to strong Northerly winds eased to light by dawn. The freezing level was around 700 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "There is a blanket of soft new snow on most aspects and levels. Unstable windslab is most widespread on Northerly through East to South aspects above 800 metres, stability is better below this altitude.  Many other aspects are affected by recent cross loading. Cornices are fragile.   The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

Unstable windslab is present in wind sheltered locations on North-East through East to South aspects above 800 metres.

Accumulations of new unstable windslab will form in wind sheltered locations mainly on North-West through North to Easterly aspects mostly above 850 metres. Localised windslab deposits will persist on South-East and Southerly aspects but to a lesser extent.
