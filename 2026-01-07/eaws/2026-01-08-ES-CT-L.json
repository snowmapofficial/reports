        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes strong northerly wind, sometimes deep wind slabs will form during the course of the night adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects. In all aspects they will increase in size as the day progresses. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. At the southern and eastern borders of Aran these avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> Dry avalanches can additionally be released in deeper layers in particular on little-used, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> All aspects and low and intermediate altitudes: As a consequence of warming dry and moist avalanches are possible from midday, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for experience and great restraint.",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs represent the main danger. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection."
