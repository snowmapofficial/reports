Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. Mostly avalanches are small. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Only isolated mostly small gliding avalanches are possible. Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep grassy slopes."
