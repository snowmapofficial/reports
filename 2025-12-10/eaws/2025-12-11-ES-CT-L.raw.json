They are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. Even during the day small moist snow slides are possible. They can be released by people. <br/> <br/> Southern border of Aran, High altitudes: The more recent wind slabs are mostly small but in some cases prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Thursday: The weather will be sunny at times. The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze and will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Slight decrease in danger of moist avalanches as the temperature drops.","tendencyType":"decreasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-11T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-12T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-11"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["NE","SW","NW","N","W","S","SE","E"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["SW","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"c8a98740-bc6c-4ad8-8b50-904dc96a96af","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
