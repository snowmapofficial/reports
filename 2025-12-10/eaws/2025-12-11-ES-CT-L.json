The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2400 m. Even during the day small moist snow slides are possible. They can be released by people. <br/> <br/> Southern border of Aran, High altitudes: The more recent wind slabs are mostly small but in some cases prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",
