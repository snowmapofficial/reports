The freezing level will fall to around summit levels at dawn before rising to well above the summits for the duration of the day.  Gale force South-Westerly winds overnight, these will become Southerly through the day.\nObserved Weather Influences: Sleet and snow at summit levels on gale to storm force South-Westerly winds.  The freezing level was around the highest summits.\nObservedSnowStability: Isolated and shallow accumulations of windslab developed on North to East aspects mainly above 1100 metres. In general the old snowpack remains stable and is mostly confined to areas above 1000 metres such as corrie back walls and the plateau.  Remaining cornices are prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard is Low."
