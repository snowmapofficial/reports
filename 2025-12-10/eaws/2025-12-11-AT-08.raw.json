In addition, older snowdrift accumulations are in isolated cases still prone to triggering on steep shady slopes, in isolated cases triggerable by winter sports enthusiasts, but generally small-sized As a result of daytime rise in temperatures, mostly small wet loose-snow avalanches are possible. Glide-snow avalanches continue to slide away naturally on steep smooth-ground slopes."

      "comment" : "Up to high altitudes, the snowpack has been weakened by rain impact. Nocturnal outgoing radiation effects are dampened somewhat by high-altitude cloudbanks, the snowpack can thus consolidate only at superficial levels. During the course of the day the snowpack softens up particularly on sunny slopes and at low altitudes, and the danger of wet-snow avalanches again increases somewhat. Older snowdrift accumulations have been generatedf atop an unfavorable old snowpack surface, particularly at high altitudes on shady slopes. Also at high altitudes, mostly on shady slopes, faceted intermediate layers occur inside the snowpack."
