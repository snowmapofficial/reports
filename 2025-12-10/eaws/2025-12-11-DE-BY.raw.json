      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is moderate above 2200 metres and low below. Old snow is the main problem. Slab avalanches can be triggered at high altitudes on very steep slopes in the northern exposures, especially with high additional loads. A break propagation and thus avalanches of medium size are possible in wind-protected hollows. Otherwise, avalanches usually remain small and the risk of falling must be taken into account.\n  \nIndividual sliding snow avalanches can spontaneously slide down extremely steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet been discharged. These are usually small."

      "comment" : "The snow cover is hardened and icy in open areas up to high altitudes. Above approx. 2400 m, the snow cover becomes thinner and is no longer stable everywhere on the shaded side. Below the snow cover, the snow has an angular structure; in places, a layer of surface frost that is susceptible to disruption remains in the upper half metre of snow. The snow cover softens during the course of the day, especially on the sunny side and at lower altitudes. There are still occasional sliding movements on smooth ground. On the south side, the ground is increasingly pitting in the middle layers."
