        "Comment": "Settled conditions expected to continue with snow cover gradually depleting. Expect a high windchill on exposed summits.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be a dry day with good periods of sunshine. The strong South-West wind will slowly moderate through the period, gradually backing to the East. The freezing level will be at summit level initially, gradually lowering to around 500 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change expected. The snowpack will be patchy and generally well consolidated with good stability throughout. Limited snow cover below 700 metres with much bare ground around the summits. Most snow exists in high North through East to South-East aspects and will remain firm in many locations.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Moderate to fresh South-Easterly winds backing to East-South-Easterly and strengthening with strong gusts over the summits.",

Localised areas of  windslab still remain in sheltered locations mainly on North to East aspects above 850 metres, deeper accumulations are poorly bonded. These areas are not particularly extensive, tops of gullies and steep coire rims are most affected. Some fragile cornices also exist above similar aspects. Snow cover on other aspects is generally shallow and stability is good. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
