Avalanches can become large at higher altitudes.\n\nThere is also a pronounced wet snow problem in the morning. Moist and wet loose snow and slab avalanches are released from steep areas of all aspects. Wet snow avalanches are expected up to an altitude of around 1800 metres. Exposed transportation routes may be affected."

They are widely lying on soft layers or surface hoar and are interspersed with weak intermediate layers. By mid-morning, the snowfall will change to rain at medium altitudes, further weakening the snow cover, snowpack. Weak layers can collapse if moisture gets in.
