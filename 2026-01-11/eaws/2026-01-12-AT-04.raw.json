      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is classified as considerable, mainly at higher altitudes, and in some cases above the tree line. Strong, sometimes stormy winds in the higher elevations have formed prone-to-triggering wind slabs that are easy to trigger. Note the drifts in the eastern sector, on the south side, but also in other aspects. Medium slab avalanches can be triggered in filled steep slopes as well as in steep bowls and gullies by even a small additional load. These avalanche prone locations should be avoided. With the significant warming, small loose snow avalanches are possible in steep terrain during the daytime changes. Wet snow avalanches are also possible in rain up to 1500 metres above sea level."
