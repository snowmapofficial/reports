Below about 2400 m, gliding avalanches are still expected on slippery ground in all aspects.  <br/>  At high altitudes, there is about twice as much snow as there normally is at the beginning of December. The snowpack has a favourable structure, apart from thin weak layers of angular crystals deep in the snowpack in the area of older rain crusts. With all the new snow and intense rain, these weak layers could be reactivated in the next few days. In the south, the snow depths are below average and the weak layers are therefore closer to the surface. Especially there, the older weak layers can also be partially released by people.</p>"

The snowfall level will be between 2000 and 2400 m in the west and between 1600 and 2000 m in the east. Above 2500 m, 60 to 100 cm of snow will fall on the northern Alpine Ridge, in Valais and from northern Pr\u00e4ttigau to Silvretta, and locally even more is expected in the westernmost and northern Lower Valais and from the western Bernese Oberand to the Central Alps of Switzerland. The westerly wind is often strong.  <br/>  Danger level 4 (high) is expected to be reached in the extreme west of Lower Valais and on parts of the northern Alpine Ridge on Monday, then on Tuesday in large parts of Valais and the northern Alpine Ridge, and possibly also from northern Pr\u00e4ttigau to Silvretta. Below 2000 to 2400 m, some large, wet avalanches are expected. Dry avalanches are expected from starting zones at higher altitudes, which will sweep along the increasingly saturated old snowpack in their path and advance into the valleys in the usual avalanche tracks. These avalanches can become very large and exposed parts of transportation routes are at risk. The conditions will be dangerous for winter sports outside marked and open pistes.  <br/>  In the other regions of Grisons, the avalanche danger will also increase, though not as much, with less new snow. In the far south, the avalanche danger will not change significantly in mostly sunny weather.</p>"
