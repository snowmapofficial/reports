Especially the northern steep slopes are dangerous, where less stable snow slabs and pillows may be winding up and not connected to the hard ground. Such unstable formations will form on slopes of all orientations due to variable winds. Avalanche release is already possible with a small additional load, especially on slopes above 40\u00b0.",

Light snowfall and fairly strong winds are expected over the next few days, which will further aggravate the situation."
