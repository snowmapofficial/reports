On W/N/E facing slopes there are faceted layers near melt-freeze crusts which are trigger-prone in isolated cases. At low and intermediate altitudes the snowpack is already thoroughly wet down to the ground.  On sunny slopes there is a melt-freeze crust, mostly capable of bearing loads, but on Tuesday it will not turn to firn snow. On shady slopes the melt-freeze crust above 1800 m is often not capable of bearing loads, breakable crusts can be expected."
