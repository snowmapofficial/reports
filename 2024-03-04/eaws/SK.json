Here it can occur mechanically, but also spontaneously released avalanches. All orientations are dangerous. On steep, predominantly grassy slopes, large foundation avalanches are possible, which can hit valley roads. At altitudes above 1600 m above sea level, there are locally wind-pounded slabs and pillows, which can be released with large additional loads. Especially on steep slopes of northern orientations.",
