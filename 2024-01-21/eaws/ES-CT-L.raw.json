The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m."

      "comment" : "The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 50 to 60 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
