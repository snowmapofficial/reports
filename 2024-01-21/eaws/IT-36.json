Large and, in isolated cases, very large natural avalanches are possible. <br/> The wind slabs can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. <br/> As a consequence of warming, the likelihood of natural moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in particular on steep sunny slopes above the tree line. In the event of solar radiation caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls. Slides can occur on cut slopes.",
