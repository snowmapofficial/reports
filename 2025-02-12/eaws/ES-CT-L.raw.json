The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> The new snow remains prone to triggering in particular on sunny slopes. Small snow slides and avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones. Very steep shady slopes: In addition an appreciable danger of dry snow slides exists. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack are difficult to recognise. These can in isolated cases be released by a single winter sport participant. Avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on little used shady slopes."

      "comment" : "Thursday: 5 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until the early morning. <br/> <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
