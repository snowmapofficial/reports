The old snowpack is weak, but doesn’t tend towards fracture propagation since the requisite slab is lacking. On shady slopes that are wind-protected there is loose snow. On sunny slopes the layering of the below-average snowpack is stable, and gliding over smooth ground has seldom been observed."

Snowdrift accumulations can in some places be triggered even by one sole skier, esp. in steep ridgeline terrain, also on slopes behind protruberances in the landscape which are distant from ridgelines where they lie deposited atop a weak fundament, esp. on very steep shady slopes. Avalanches can grow to medium size if they fracture to more deeply embedded layers.  Naturally triggered, mostly small glide-snow avalanches are possible in isolated cases."

Inside the old snowpack on very steep shady slopes there are weak layers of faceted crystals. On the one hand, the snow was able to metamorphose esp. where snow is shallow; on the other, below the near-surface melt-freeze crust there are also faceted crystals. Snowdrifts can form a slab on the surface above the faceted crystals. On shady slopes loose snow is still evident."
