Fresh snow and newly generated drifts will increase in frequency with ascending altitude, often poorly bonded with the snowpack surface. Triggerings of small-to-medium loose-snow and slab avalanches are possible by the loading of one sole skier. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the dangers of being swept along and forced to take a fall need adequate consideration. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches continues to be difficult to assess, for that reason avoid zones below glide cracks."

In ridgeline and pass areas, fresh snowdrifts will be generated over small areas under the impact of intermittently strong-velocity winds."

On wind-protected shady slopes the fresh snow will blanket the powdery layers, often a breakable or non-breakable wind crust and on steep sunny slopes a melt-freeze crust. In ridgeline and pass areas, fresh snowdrifts will be generated over small areas under the impact of intermittently strong-velocity winds.\nThe snowpack is well consolidated up to high altitudes. Particularly on shady slopes there are weak layers evident which can easily be triggered. Snowpack surfaces are often powdery on shady, wind-protected slopes. Elsewhere there are wind crusts and a melt-freeze crust evident. Elsewhere a wind crust is evident which is often capable of bearing loads, on sunny slopes there is a melt-crust. Small snowdrift accumulations are evident. During the course of the day, the superficially encrusted snowpack will moisten/soften on steep sunny slopes. Small-area fresh snowdrifts have been generated."
