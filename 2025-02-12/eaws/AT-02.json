Danger zones occur mostly in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls, a on very steep shady slopes above 2200m.  In isolated cases avalanches can reach medium size.  Attention must be given to the dangers of being swept along and forced to take a fall.",
