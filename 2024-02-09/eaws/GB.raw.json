        "Summary": "CM for 10.2. Turbulent winds - all aspects affected by localised unstable windslab above 950m initially. Avalanche Hazard Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Very hard snow ice on exposed windward slopes. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph making progress very difficult and strenuous at higher elevations.",
        "Comment": "A challenging day in prospect with overnight snow and storm force winds. A bitterly cold day is expected.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Persistant snow is expected overnight before a dry day. Winds will be storm force Easterlies overnight, before gradually backing to become moderate East-North-Easterly by the end of the period. The freezing level will be around 500 metres overnight, rising to 800 metres by the end of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will be deposited overnight and redistributed during the day. Initially, all aspects will be affected above 950 metres with localised deposits due to cross loading in multi aspect gully tops. Later, windward slopes will become scoured and firm with distribution of windslab greatest on South through South-West to North aspects above 950 metres. A fresh covering of snow will lie above 400 metres. Fragile cornices will develop. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Continuous light snow showers for most of the day, on very strong South-Easterly to East-South-Easterly winds.  Cold temperatures with a freezing level of around 400 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is firm and stable in most locations. The greatest cover is confined to gullies and depressions in the high coires above 950 metres. Isolated accumulations of soft windslab have been deposited in very steep, wind sheltered locations. These accumulations are unstable where they overlie the older firm snowpack, particularly on North to East aspects above 850 metres. Outwith these locations a dusting of snow is present above 350 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be snow this evening and overnight, though amounts are uncertain. Remaining mainly dry through the day, as the freezing level rises to around 800 metres. Initially gale force, the Easterly winds will steadily decrease overnight and throughout the period.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will continue to form in wind sheltered locations mainly on South-West to North-West aspects above 750 metres. Accumulations will be localised and mostly falling on bare ground. The remaining old snowpack, on mainly North to East aspects above 750 metres, will be scoured, frozen and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab has formed in sheltered locations on mainly Westerly aspects above 750 metres. These accumulations are isolated and shallow in nature, lying mostly on bare ground, and are therefore not significant. The remaining old snowpack, on mainly North to East aspects above 750 metres, has been scoured and is frozen and stable. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Coire rims, gully tops and ridge flanks most affected. Elsewhere a shallow cover of snow will lie on bare ground.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",

At higher elevations and mostly above 950 metres there are some very isolated pockets of windslab on South-West to North-West aspects, although weak, these deposits are easily avoidable, otherwise snow lies on bare ground.

Primarily this is on South-West to North-West aspects above 700 metres where cornices are also rapidly developing. Very poor bonding observed between underlying old snow and the new storm snow on a Westerly aspect at 700 metres.  Wind exposed slopes are scoured. As the day progressed accumulations below 600 metres stabilised as the temperatures rose. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
