        "comment": "The snowpack is in many places in the morning encrusted and capable of bearing loads. As the day progresses it softens again in particular in the sun. The snowpack is extremely compact and stable. Up to high altitudes it is isothermal and frequently wet at ground level. Gliding movements of snow masses over smooth ground are the consequence. Even on north-facing slopes there is only little snow left below 1300 m; on south-facing slopes the ground is completely bare approximately up to the treeline. \r\n"
