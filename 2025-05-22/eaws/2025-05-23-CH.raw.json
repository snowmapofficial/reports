Particularly on steep north-facing slopes above around 3000 m and on all aspects above around 3500 m, the snowpack was still mostly dry before the current snowfall and in some cases also contained weak layers.

Below around 3000 m, however, the old snowpack was water-saturated and contained hardly any weak layers.</p><p>Fresh snow and wind resulted in wind slabs forming on Thursday, especially in the high Alpine regions. On Friday, further wind slabs will form in the areas with fresh snow on the Northern Alpine Ridge and in Grisons, as well as in the regions with strong northerly winds along the Main Alpine Ridge.
