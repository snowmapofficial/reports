        "comment": "In the high altitudes of the High, Western and Low Tatras there is a low avalanche danger (1.degree). No new snow has fallen for several days, and due to the alternation of positive and negative temperatures during the day and at night, the snow cover is stable. Only sporadic drifts of wet snow may appear. At high altitudes, in couloirs, under saddles and rock faces, there are still snow slabs and pillows on the northern, shaded slopes, which can cause avalanche release with high additional loads. However, there are very few such locations.",
