        "comment": "An increasing number of medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large wet and gliding avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation. This applies in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2600 m. <br/> <br/> Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places by individual winter sport participants. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep, little used west, north and east facing slopes above the tree line. Mostly avalanches are medium-sized. In isolated cases avalanches can also release deeper layers of the snowpack and reach large size. <br/> <br/> In addition the mostly small wind slabs should be taken into account, in particular on very steep shady slopes adjacent to ridgelines in high Alpine regions. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",
