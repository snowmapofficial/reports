        "comment": "Daytime warming and solar radiation lead to increasing avalanche danger during the course of the day. In early morning, danger above 2300m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. During the daytime it rises at all altitudes to moderate. Below 2400m, increasingly frequent small-to-medium wet-snow avalanches are possible in as aspects on steep slopes. In zones which have not yet discharged, also higher up. Small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on very steep grass-covered slopes. Above 2300m in some places, dry slab avalanches can be triggered even by one sole skier. Danger zones occur in very steep terrain and on liitle-tracked NW/NE facing slopes. Releases can fracture in the old snowpack and down to more deeply embedded layers, thereby reaching medium size.\nAvalanche danger is moderate. Wet-snow avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier on steep slopes in all aspects in steep sunny terrain which has not yet discharged. Small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on extremely steep grass-covered slopes. Above 2300m, dry slab avalanches can still be triggered by one sole skier. Danger zones occur on very steep, little-tracked slopes on NW/NE facing slopes. Avalanches can fracture down to more deeply embedded layers in the snowpack and reach medium size. Small freshly generated snowdrift patches are often prone to triggering, esp. on very steep shady slopes in high-alpine ridgeline terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall demand adequate consideration.",
