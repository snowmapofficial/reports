Due to warming and sun radiation predominantly small, sometimes medium sized wet loose-snow avalanches can trigger. Danger spots are found especially in full, steep gullies and slopes of all expositions. Weak layers within the old snow can be triggered only by high additional loads in extremely steep shady slopes and lead to dry slab avalanches.",
