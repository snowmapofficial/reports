      "comment" : "Near-surface weak layers are often still prone to triggering, esp. on little-tracked steep shady slopes. On shady steep high-altitude slopes and in ridgeline terrain, small-area snowdrift accumulations require caution. One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution.  On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible."

      "comment" : "Nighttime skies will be lightly cloudy to cloudless, thus the snowpack will cool and a crust capable of bearing loads will form. Due to daytime warmth and solar radiation the melt-freeze crust will soften up. At high altitudes in ridgeline terrain, some snowdrifts will accumulate. On shady slopes at high and high-alpine altitudes the older drifts lie atop an unfavorable old snowpack, which are often still prone to triggering. A cohesive area-wide snowpack is evident mostly over 1400m on shady slopes. It is moiset at hight altitudes and weakened through the rain. Gliding movements over smooth ground are possible. On south-facing slopes there is little snow on the ground, and only sparsely up to high altitudes."
