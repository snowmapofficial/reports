On very steep slopes in all aspects, wet glide-snow avalanches can release naturally over smooth ground. Avalanches tend to be small sized, but can grow to medium size in isolated cases. Furthermore, it is possible that small wet loose snow avalanches trigger spontaneously in extremely steep terrain during the course of the day, in particular due to solar radiation. Isolated small dry slab avalanches can release on very steep high altitude slopes close to ridgelines in W/N/E aspects."
