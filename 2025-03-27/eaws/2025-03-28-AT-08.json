On shady steep high-altitude slopes and in ridgeline terrain, small-area snowdrift accumulations require caution. One sole winter sports enthusiast can trigger mostly small slab avalanches in these zones. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution.  On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow, isolated medium-sized glide-snow avalanches still possible.",
