The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase from midday. <br/> <br/> Some small and medium-sized gliding avalanches have been released in the last two days. In particular sunny slopes,: Slides are to be expected on steep grassy slopes. Some occasionally large avalanches are not ruled out. <br/> <br/> As the moisture increases moist snow slides and avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can be released by a single winter sport participant or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at low and intermediate altitudes and on steep sunny slopes. Some medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection. The avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."
