Small to medium avalanches from wet snow are expected on steep, sunlit slopes. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads, but spontaneous avalanches are also possible occasionally. At high altitudes, snow slabs and pillows of wind-drifted snow may still be present on shady slopes. Their distribution is localised, but an avalanche is possible when they are loaded.",
