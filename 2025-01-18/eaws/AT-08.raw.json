      "comment" : "Small-area avalanche prone locations in the form of fresh and older snowdrift accumulations, esp. in wind-loaded steep terrain, in gullies and bowls, and behind protruberances in the landscape, on shady slopes often triggerable above the treeline by one sole skier and then possibly growing to medium size. However, the danger zones are easy to recognize for the practiced eye, thus, should be circumvented. In high-alpine regions the danger zones occur more frequently and the risks are greater. On steep shady slopes at high altitudes where the snow is shallow and in transitions from shallow to deep snow, slab avalanches can be triggered. A cautious route selection is imperative. At lower altitudes, isolated small avalanches are possibly triggered in extremely steep terrain. Naturally triggered small loose-snow avalanches are possible on extremely steep sunny slopes."

      "comment" : "Moderate-to-strong southerly winds are generating fresh snowdrift accumulations, they will lie deposited on shady steep slopes atop weak layers and are prone to triggering. Elsewhere, the snowpack is stabilizing. The near-surface layers are still generally loosely-packed, except where winds have had their effect. There are lots of wind crusts and, on south-facing slopes, a shallow surface crust. More deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack are unlikely to trigger, at most where the snow is shallow and on very steep shady slopes."
