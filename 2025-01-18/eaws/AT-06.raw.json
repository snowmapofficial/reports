These avalanches are usually small but can reach medium size in some places. Danger spots are usually located in shady northwestern to eastern expositions especially in transitions from little to much snow, in entries to steep gullies and bowls and behind ridgelines. The danger areas start in lightly forested areas and increase with height. Spontaneous loose-snow avalanches on sunny extremely steep rock areas are possible."

In addition persistent weak layers are there for a longer period due to low amounts of snow and faceted snow layers and crusts which are weakening the snow base."
