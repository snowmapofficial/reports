Avalanches can in isolated cases fracture down to more deeply embedded layers in the old snopwack and then grow to medium size.  On shady slopes and in high alpine zones the likelihood of triggering is higher. Caution urged especially in seldom-skied terrain."

Clear skies are forecast, with low temperatures and low air moisture. Thus, the snowpack will expansively metamorphose during the nocturnal hours.
