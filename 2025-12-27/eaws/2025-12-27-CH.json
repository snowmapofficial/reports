Although these weak layers have proven triggerable in stability tests, it is very rare for avalanches actually to be triggered. Where fresh and somewhat older snowdrift accumulations are lying on the weak snowpack, small avalanches are possible. On wind-protected shady slopes, the surface of the snowpack is faceted and loose.</li><li>The snowpack structure is more favourable in western and northern Lower Valais and on the northern flank of the Alps. Below 2400 m, the snowpack has mostly frozen solid.</li></ul>"
