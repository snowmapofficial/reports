A moderate to brisk north-westerly wind will blow. At 1500 metres around -2 degrees, at 2000 metres around -4 degrees.\nOn Monday, the sun will mostly shine all day. There will be little early morning fog, which will clear quickly. With a brisk westerly wind, temperatures will change little, highs: minus 1 to plus 5 degrees."
