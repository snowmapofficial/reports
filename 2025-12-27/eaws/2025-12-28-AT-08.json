At high altitudes, small-sized snowdrift accumulations occur from place to place. On shady slopes in high alpine regions, isolated weak layers occur inside the snowpack. South-facing slopes are bare of snow up to high altitudes. Only limited information from outlying terrain is currently available to the Avalanche Warning Services."
