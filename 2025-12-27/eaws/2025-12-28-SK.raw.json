      "comment" : "In all mountain ranges where there is still a continuous snow cover (High, Low, Western Tatras) there is only a SMALL avalanche danger. The snow cover has stabilised due to the change in temperature. In the north and in the shade there is still loose, square-grained snow and small snow slabs in places. Up to 5 cm of new snow will fall with strong winds. Locally, small snow slabs may form. Due to the small amount of new snow, they can mainly cause shearing and falling. Increase caution in areas with accumulated large amounts of new snow.",

A continuous snow cover occurs in the Low Tatras from an altitude of about 1300 m and reaches 40 to 70 cm at the highest altitudes. In the Western and High Tatras there is snow from about 1600 m above sea level and its height is only up to 40 cm. In the north and in shady localities there is sometimes loose, square-grained snow in the snow cover."
