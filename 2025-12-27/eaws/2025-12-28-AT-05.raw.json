On the one hand, where older wind slab snow has formed a suitable board over a weak layer in the persistent weak layer. On the other hand, close to the surface in the wind slab of the last few days, which is still prone to triggering. In addition to the risk of burial, particular attention should be paid to the risk of entrainment."

In high, shady slopes, the melt-freeze crust is usually covered by edged snow with no binding, which can serve as a weak layer in exceptional cases. The potential for fracture propagation is generally low due to the overall highly built-up, transformed snow cover, snowpack. Fractures within the snow cover are most possible in the thin wind slab or over the hard old snow foundation from early winter. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
