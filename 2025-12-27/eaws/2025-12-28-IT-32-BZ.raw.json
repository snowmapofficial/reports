Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. <br/> <br/> The somewhat older wind slabs are in some cases prone to triggering in particular on steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Such avalanche prone locations are rare and are easy to recognise. Caution is to be exercised adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. <br/> <br/> Mostly avalanches are small. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Shady slopes above approximately 2600 m: Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> The somewhat older wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on shady slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. Hardly any snow is lying on south facing slopes.
