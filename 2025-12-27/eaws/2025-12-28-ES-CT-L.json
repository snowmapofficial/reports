        "comment": "The fresh snow and all the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on very steep shady slopes. This snow is lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are sometimes deep and prone to triggering. They are covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong southeasterly wind, further wind slabs will form by Sunday in particular on north and west facing slopes. Sometimes dry avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. <br/> <br/> In particular in the southeastern half of Aran the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. Ski touring and other off-piste activities, including snowshoe hiking, call for experience and restraint.",

Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: The new snow and wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations confirm this situation. <br/> <br/> Sunday: Some snow will fall in the next few hours in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. In particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas high altitudes: The southeasterly wind will transport the new snow. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
