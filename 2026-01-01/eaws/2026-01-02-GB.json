Precipitation will fall as snow showers sometimes persistent with drifting.  Freezing level around 100m\nObserved Weather Influences: Gale force, gusting storm force, generally North-Westerly winds throughout the day. Snow showers sometimes persistent throughout the day. Freezing level around 300m or so.\nObservedSnowStability: A dusting of new snow with deeper accumulations in wind sheltered pockets has formed on most aspects above 500m on the coastal mountains. Further inland there is a thin cover of snow with greatest accumulations in wind sheltered places on Easterly through South to South-Westerly aspects  mainly above 800 metres. Gully lines and coire rims most affected. Deposits here are generally shallow, isolated  and avoidable. The avalanche hazard is Low"
