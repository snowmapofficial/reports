Storms from the northwest have been depositing fresh wind slab snow on an unfavourably built-up old snow surface for several days. From around 2400 m, avalanches can be triggered by individuals in some places and occasionally become medium-sized. There is a risk of burial in particular near terrain traps, i.e. in areas adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit. The drift snow packs are usually easily recognisable."

Fractures are most possible here, the drift snow layers are poorly connected to each other and to the melt-freeze crust in some places. Underneath, there is usually edgy snow with no binding. Due to the overall heavily built-up transformed snow cover, the potential for fracture propagation in the old snowpack is generally low. The snow depth is well below average at all altitudes."
