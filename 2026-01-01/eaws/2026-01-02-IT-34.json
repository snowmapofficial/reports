        "comment": "Today the wind was moderate to strong adjacent to ridgelines over a wide area. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in northwest to north to northeast facing aspects and at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. <br/> As a consequence of a freshening wind from northwesterly directions, further wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines as well as at elevated altitudes. The sometimes strong wind will transport the old snow. The rather small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases especially on extremely steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. <br/> Precarious weak layers exist in the snowpack on shady slopes. Whumpfing sounds serve as an alarm indicating the danger. Avalanches can in isolated cases be triggered in the old snowpack and reach medium size in particular on extremely steep shady slopes. Avalanches can additionally be released, even by small loads in isolated cases.",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs represent the main danger. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution and restraint."
