The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. As a consequence of the strong westerly wind the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.
