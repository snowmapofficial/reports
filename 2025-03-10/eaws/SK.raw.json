      "comment" : "In all mountain ranges of Slovakia is declared a SMALL avalanche danger (1st degree). The snow has generally melted and stabilized due to changing temperatures. On the northern shady sides of the mountain ranges it is still possible to find very locally places with dry, untreated snow, the stability of which is weak. Avalanche release is expected mainly on very steep to extremely steep terrain, especially with large additional loads. Only small or medium avalanches are expected, but the problem is the transport and accumulation zone of the deposits, where, due to the low snow cover, there is often rock debris or exposed rock blocks. Locally, spontaneous smaller avalanches or avalanches are possible in places exposed to sunlight or rain.",

It retains its powdery character on the isolated S-facing slopes of the highest altitudes. During the night the snowpack hardens, during the day it is expected to melt locally in sunlit places, especially on S exposures."
