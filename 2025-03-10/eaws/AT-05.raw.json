Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall demand adequate consideration. During the course of the day, small loose-snow slides continue to be possible. On steep grass-covered slopes, isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible."

During the course of the day, this crust softens, the surface becomes moist and can forfeit its bonding."
