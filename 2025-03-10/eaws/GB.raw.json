        "Summary": "SC 11.03 Old snow patches mostly on NW-NE above 900m. Windslab, northern area, wind sheltered SE-SW aspects above 900m. Hazard Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Limited patchy snow in specific places. Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells.",
        "Comment": "Continued Northerly airflow for the remainder of the week. \r\nRemaining snow mostly firm and icy with unfavourable runouts.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be very strong to gale force Northerly winds overnight which will back North-Westerly during the morning. It will be mostly dry overnight with small amounts of snow during the afternoon. The freezing level will rise from around 500 metres to 800 metres throughout the course of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The old snow patches will remain firm and icy. Fresh snowfall will lie mostly on bare ground and be generally insignificant. Along the high Northern boundary mountains, where slightly more snow has been forecast, localised windslab will continue to form in steeper wind sheltered locations, mainly where it gains depth on mainly South-East to South-West aspects above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light snow showers arrived during the morning on a very strong to gale force North-Easterly wind. The freezing level dropped throughout the day to around 750 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining old snow patches are mostly firm, icy and stable. The greatest amounts are found in steeper locations on North-West to North-East aspects and on a few higher altitude East aspects above 900 meters. A fresh dusting of new snow lies mainly on bare ground above 750 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground. Good visibility.  Winds approx 10mph to 20mph.",
        "Comment": "Firm snow patches are mainly avoidable though in places with higher consequence require greater care. Paths will become icy. Staying cold into Wednesday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Remaining mainly dry with only light showers during the afternoon. These showers will fall as snow above around 800 metres as the freezing level rises through the day. Strong North-Easterly winds this evening ease slightly becoming moderate to fresh from North-Westerly directions.",
        "SnowStability": "Remaining snow patches will be present in mainly Northerly and Easterly corries and gullies above 900m metres. These patches will continue to refreeze and become firm. Stability will be good. There will be a dusting of new snow above 800 metres later in the day, however amounts will not be significant. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Dry and overcast with brighter spells. colder with the freezing level around 900 metres. Winds were fresh to strong from the North-East.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining snowpack is limited to patches mainly in Northerly and Easterly corries and gullies above 900 metres, with some isolated patches below this. At most elevations the snowpack has begun to refreeze in the colder conditions with a surface crust forming. Snow stability is good. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

The freezing level will rise from 500 metres overnight to peak at 800 metres midday. The strong North-East wind will ease slightly overnight, backing Northerly same time.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be a light covering of new snow on most aspects, mainly above 700 metres. Instabilities may be present in pockets of windslab developing in steep wind sheltered locations, but will be isolated and mostly avoidable.

        "SnowStability": "Redistribution of the new snow will continue to develop isolated and generally avoidable deposits of windslab in wind sheltered locations on South-East through South to West aspects above 1000 metres. Instabilities will be present where these deposits gain depth or overlie the older re-frozen snowpack. Other aspects and lower elevations will also be affected due to cross loading. Elsewhere the new snow will overlie bare ground. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
