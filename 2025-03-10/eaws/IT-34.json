In some localities 40 cm of snow fell in the past few hours above approximately 2000 m. The wind was light to moderate. The new snow can be released naturally in all aspects above the tree line. In particular on steep slopes medium-sized dry avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of the new snow. On very steep shady slopes the avalanches can be released in deep layers of the snowpack. The light wind has transported only a little snow. The fresh wind slabs have formed in particular in the vicinity of peaks. Even single winter sport participants can release avalanches, including medium-sized ones. Bases of rock walls are especially precarious.",
