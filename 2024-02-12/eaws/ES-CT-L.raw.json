      "comment" : "The wind slabs of the weekend can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. The avalanches are rather small but in many cases easily released. Individual medium-sized avalanches are nontheless possible. At high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> On very steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides are possible in all altitude zones."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "In some regions up to 25 cm of snow fell in the last few days. The moderate wind has transported the new snow significantly. The wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. <br/> <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
