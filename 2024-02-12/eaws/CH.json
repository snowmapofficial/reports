However, the old snow surface was also angular in places and therefore less favourable, especially on north-facing slopes at a distance from ridgelines and sheltered from the wind.</p><p>In the north, wind slabs formed on Friday and Saturday as a result of the strong southerly winds, and on Sunday due to the westerly winds. These are mostly only thin, but they proved prone to triggering at the weekend.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible. This applies particularly to east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely to north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in some cases in regions with a lot of snow.</p>"
