Avalanches can be released by a single winter sport participant and reach large size. The avalanche prone locations are rare but are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Caution is to be exercised in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow. <br/> As a consequence of a strengthening westerly wind, mostly small wind slabs will form at elevated altitudes. <br/> Ski touring calls for defensive route selection. Maintaining distances between individuals and one-at-a-time descents are recommended.",

By Friday morning, 15 to 30 cm of snow is expected in the western Jura, on the northern flank of the Alps and in the extreme west of Lower Valais, and 10 to 20 cm in the rest of the Jura and Valais and in northern Grisons. Little or no snow will fall further south. While the snow is falling, there will initially be strong westerly winds and later on moderate northwesterly winds. On Friday, it will remain cloudy for longer in the east and along the Prealps, otherwise conditions will be fairly sunny. On Saturday, conditions will be sunny in the mountains at first. In the afternoon, clouds will gather from the west as the southwesterly wind increases.</p><p>Fresh and drifted snow will be deposited mainly on shady slopes on an unfavourable surface of faceted crystals and sometimes also on surface hoar frost. Avalanche danger is expected to increase to level 3 (considerable) in the north and far west on Friday. In other regions, it will increase slightly, especially at high altitudes. There will be little change in avalanche danger on Saturday.</p>"
