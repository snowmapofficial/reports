Above 2000m small, in isolated cases also medium-sized avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts in steep terrain. Danger zones occur esp. on steep shady ridgeline slopes. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow on the ground or atop smooth ground, increasingly frequent small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible."

Brisk SW winds will transport the frseh snow, also some of the loose old snow, and mostly thin snowdrift accumulations will be generated. Also on Sunday, the strong foehn winds will form small snowdrifts. Due to dense cloud cover moving in on Sunday night, the snowpack surface cannot firm up sufficiently. Below 2000-1800m, light rainfall will weaken the already moist snowpack still further."
