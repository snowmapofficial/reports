Avalanches tend to be small-sized, triggerable even by one sole person. Moderate strength winds from the south: often trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations will be generated in ridgeline teerrain, esp. at high altitudes. Weak layers inside the old snow can be triggered in isolated cases, esp. on very steep W/N/E facing slopes and at the foot of rock wall. Avalanches can in isolated cases grow to medium size."
