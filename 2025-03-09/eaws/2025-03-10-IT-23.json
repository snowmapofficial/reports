The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs that are forming adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls will be deposited on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in particular on shady slopes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found between approximately 2200 and 2800 m. <br/> The fresh snow and the wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant,. Small and medium-sized dry avalanches are to be expected from the second half of the night. <br/> 20 to 40 cm of snow, and up to 50 cm in some localities, will fall until the early morning above approximately 1400 m. The maximum amounts of fresh snow will be reached in the areas bordering Piedmont. Here the likelihood of avalanches is higher.",
