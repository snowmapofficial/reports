The Foehn-wind ends in the morning and after that dense clouds coming from southwest will dominate from noon on the whole mountain area. Convective precipitation (showers) is called even in high altitudes and it will be rainy or with sleet. Strong winds are called. Temperatures at noon will be 2 degrees in 2.000 m and 4 degrees in 1.500 m. Tuesday will start sunny but with the strong radiation clouds are forming during the course of the day and rain/sleet showers are forecasted. Temperatures will not change significantly but the winds will be weak."

There - in shady areas or adjacent to ridgelines small slab avalanches can be triggered. In extremely steep slopes on sunny areas spontaneous loose-snow avalanches can’t be ruled out. Ridgelines and summits are icy and hard. Be aware of risk of falling."

On shady slopes above 2.200 m loose snow is found in some places, and in rare cases thin snowdrift deposits which are prone to triggering have formed. The snow base is predominantly stable. The snow base, which has a very low amount considering the season is predominantly stable. Especially on sunny slopes only little amounts of snow is found even in high altitudes."
