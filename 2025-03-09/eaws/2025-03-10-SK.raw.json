      "comment" : "In all mountain ranges of Slovakia a LOW avalanche danger (1st level) is declared for Monday. The snow has generally melted and stabilized due to changing temperatures.  The snow is generally well consolidated. On the northern shady sides of the mountain ranges, it is still possible to find very locally places with dry untreated snow, the stability of which is poor. Avalanche release is expected mainly on very steep to extremely steep terrain, especially with high additional loads. Only small or medium avalanches are expected, but the problem is the transport and accumulation zone of the deposits, where, due to the low snow cover, there is often rock debris or exposed rock blocks. Clouds are expected during the day, so that the snow does not sink to a great depth, but locally there is a constant possibility of spontaneous smaller avalanches or avalanches, in places exposed to sunlight.",

It retains its powdery character on the isolated S-facing slopes of the highest altitudes. During the night the snowpack hardens, during the day it is expected to melt locally in sunlit places, especially on S exposures."
