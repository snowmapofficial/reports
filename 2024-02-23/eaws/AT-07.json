        "comment": "The large quantity of fresh snow of yesterday and the extensive wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, in all aspects above the tree line. Individual natural avalanches are further possible, especially in case of releases originating from very steep high-altitude leeward starting zones. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach quite a large size in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular above approximately 2400 m. In the regions neighbouring those that are subject to danger level 4 (high) the avalanche danger is a little higher. <br/> <br/> On steep grassy slopes more frequent medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible, especially on sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. In addition as the day progresses an increasing number of small and medium-sized loose snow avalanches are to be expected, in the event of solar radiation especially on extremely steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",
        "highlights": "Large quantities of fresh snow and the wind-drifted snow of yesterday represent the main danger. In addition an appreciable danger of gliding avalanches exists."
