New snow and wind slabs are overlaying a mostly compact old snowpack, and fractures deep in the snowpack are not generally expected.</p><p>Small and medium-sized loose snow avalanches are to be anticipated in the northeast as a result of solar radiation and milder temperatures during the day.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m.

New snow and wind slabs are overlaying a mostly compact old snowpack, and fractures deep in the snowpack are not generally expected.</p><p>Small and medium-sized loose snow avalanches are to be anticipated in the northeast as a result of solar radiation and milder temperatures during the day.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m.
