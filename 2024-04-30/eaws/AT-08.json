        "comment": "Near-surface layers and small drifts can often be triggered, unleashing a small-to-medium slab avalanche. Frequency and size of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. In case of extended bright intervals, medium-sized loose-snow avalanches are possible, possibly endangering exposed zones. Activities in outlying terrain demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. Danger rises during the course of each day due to warmth and solar radiation. Isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible. Increasing glide-snow avalanches on smooth grass-covered slopes which previously were bare. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",

Because ski areas are closed there is little information about snowpack layering at high altitudes. At low and intermediate altitudes the lower layers of the snowpack are often wet, which reinforces gliding."
