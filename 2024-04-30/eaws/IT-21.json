        "comment": "Over a wide area 30 to 40 cm of snow, but less in some localities, will fall above approximately 2500 m. The southeasterly wind will transport the snow. <br/> In some cases the wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack. Intensive rain to intermediate altitudes: The weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack."
