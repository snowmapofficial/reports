        "comment": "In the highest altitudes of the High Tatras is issued the 1st level of avalanche danger. In steep couloirs, especially in N to NW orientations and valleys, there may be a larger amount of snow, which may not be bound with the ground or old snow cover from last week. Locally, a small slide or avalanche may be released, the danger of which lies mainly in pushing a person into exposed terrain.",

        "comment": "At the highest altitudes, new snow is systematically accumulating, mainly in steep couloirs and moguls. The greatest amount of snow is on the N to NW ploughed exposures and in the N-oriented valleys. The first snow of the season poses a risk especially in steep exposed terrain where there is a risk of falling over rock thresholds and walls. During the day, snow is expected to set due to plus temperatures, rain may cause small wet runs in couloirs."
