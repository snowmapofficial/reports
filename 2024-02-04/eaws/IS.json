On January 30th, a snowpit analysis was conducted in Seljalandsdalur, revealing layered wind slabs with a hard thin layer between them atop melt/freeze snow. A compression test indicated a straight fracture under medium stress in the newer wind slabs (CT13/15@56cm). Although the upper layers of the snowpack melted temporarily over the weekend before the return of frost, a vulnerability in the snowpack emerged as dry, cold snow covered warmer, wet snow. While the thawing duration was brief, it was sufficient to create a thin layer susceptible to faceting within the snowpack."
