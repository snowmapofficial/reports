        "Summary": "GC for 5/2 Wet snow instabilities-many slopes on N to SE aspects mostly above 900m. Cornices prone to collapse. Av haz Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "No snow below 650m but new accumulations at higher altitudes but freezing level rising. Mostly cloudy on the tops and above 600 metres. Strong West-South-Westerly winds, 25-50 mph.",
        "Comment": "Large amounts of rain are forecast for the area tomorrow with freezing levels around 1800 metres.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will rise to well above the summits with large amounts of persistent rain falling at all levels. West-South-Westerly winds will remain strong to gale force.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing areas of windslab will become wet and unstable as the freezing level rises and heavy rain affects the snowpack. Wet snow instabilities are expected on wind-sheltered North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres with gully tops and coire rims particularly affected. Cornices will be prone to collapse affecting slopes below. Windward aspects will hold little snow, and stability will be much better on these aspects.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The freezing level slowly climbed to be around 1100 metres by midday. Winds were very strong West-South-Westerly and precipitation fell as snow showers, at first above 850 metres then rising through the day. New snow amounts were more frequent and slightly more than expected. Poor visibility above 600 metres with very limited views particularly in the driving snow showers in the morning.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "New snow amounts were more than expected and accumulations of moderately bonded windslab have continued to form mainly on North to East aspects above 900 metres. These deposits are generally localised but deep accumulations are weakly bonded. Steep wind sheltered locations, gully tops and coire rims are particularly affected. Fragile cornices also exist above these locations. Elsewhere the snowpack is starting to soften and moisten. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells on lower slopes. Firm snow - greatest cover above 950 metres.  Winds approx 50-60 mph at higher elevations.",
        "Comment": "A challenging day in prospect as snow transitions to rain with gale force winds.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Rain is expected at most elevations, with any wet snow confined to the highest summits above 1200 metres during the day. Winds will be from the West-South-West and gale force during daylight hours. The freezing level will rise from 1000 metres in the evening staying above the summits for the duration of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will be deposited overnight on North-East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres. Deposits will be isolated to steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims and gullies, only presenting instability where they achieve depth. A covering of wet snow is likely above 1200 metres before rain reaches all elevations. Remaining cornices will be prone to collapse. Outwith these locations the snowpack will be stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Precipitation was characterised by snow showers above 900 metres. Winds were generally gale force Westerlies for the duration of the day. At midday the freezing level was around 1000 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is generally firm and stable in most locations. The greatest snow cover is on coire headwalls, gullies and ridge flanks, of a North to East aspect above 950 metres. Small accumulations of fresh snow have been deposited on North-East to South-East above 900 metres. These are isolated to steep wind sheltered locations and are insignificant. At lower elevations the cover is patchy and slowly depleting in the mild temperatures. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
