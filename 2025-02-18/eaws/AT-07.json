The avalanche prone locations are to be found on extremely steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2400 m. These avalanche prone locations are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Caution is to be exercised in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Wind slabs are in individual cases still prone to triggering on extremely steep north and east facing slopes at elevated altitudes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. They are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
