        "Comment": "Remaining cool through tomorrow until the later part of the afternoon. Heavy rain expected at all levels through Wednesday night and into Thursday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "No precipitation is expected. Very strong to gale force South-Easterly winds. The freezing level will be above the summits, however the airmass will remain cold until late afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated accumulations of unstable windslab will persist mainly on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres, primarily around coire rims and gully tops. Generally good stability elsewhere. There will be a consolidating trend throughout the forecasting period. Cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light precipitation, mostly freezing rain. Fresh to strong South-Easterly winds. The freezing level steadily rose throughout the day but with fluctuating temperatures. The midday summit temperature was around -3 degrees Celsius.",

Following the freezing rain, there is a thin rain crust on the surface. Generally good stability elsewhere. Cornices are unstable and prone to collapse. A light dusting of new snow was evident at all levels, slowly thawing at lower elevations as the day progressed. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

Blizzard conditions during the first part of the day, clearer later. Winds 30-40 mph, over the tops, feeling stronger at lower levels due to nature of the Southerlies.",

Unstable windslab will become more widespread above 950 metres on steep wind sheltered North-West to North-East aspects, localised on West and East aspects due cross loading.
