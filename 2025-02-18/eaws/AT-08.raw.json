The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall deserve adequate consideration. Weak layers in the old snow can be triggered in steep shady terrain above 2400m, esp. in transitions from shallow to deeper snow and in zones where the snow is shallow. On very steep sunny slopes, moist slides and small loose-snow avalanches are possible. The danger of small, in isolated cases medium-sized glide-snow avalanches is still difficult to assess. Caution urged below glide cracks."
