      "comment" : "Avalanche danger above 2000m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. In few places, an avalanche can be triggered by one sole skier as a slab avalanche. Danger zones are nearly impossible to recognize, most critical behind protruberances in the landscape and in gullies and bowls. Fresh drifts on some ridgeline slopes can be easily triggered as a small slab. The wind-loaded zones are easily recognized, watch out for the risks of falling. On very steep sunny slopes, small loose-snow avalanches are possible. Isolated small naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible."

Due to winds from varying directions small snowdrifts are being generated from the loose fresh snow or faceted crystals near the near-surface crusts, these are prone to triggering. The weak layers also occur on sunny slopes. The very below-average old snow fundament consists of several crusts with faceted crystals beneath them, but all-in-all is often quite compact and only seldom tends towards fracture propagation. On sunny slopes the snow is sticky or as a thin melt-freeze crust."
