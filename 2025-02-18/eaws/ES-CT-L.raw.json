Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in isolated cases and mostly by large additional loads on very steep shady slopes. The avalanches can in isolated cases reach medium size. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> Fresh wind slabs have formed in particular in the south and in the southwest and at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> On steep sunny slopes small moist snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from the middle of the day to moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> In some places various wind slab layers are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack. In some cases the wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
