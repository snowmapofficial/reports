        "comment": "Solar radiation makes the snowpack wet, it loses its firmness. On steep rocky slopes which have again been snow on and grassy slopes, the snowpack is wet down to the ground and can glide away. The recent fresh fallen snow is quickly diminishing due to melting. During the night a melt-freeze crust capable of bearing loads often forms, but later softens rapidly. On north-facing slopes there are often breakable crusts. On sufficiently steep north-facing slopes above 2400 m there is also some powder to be found."
