        "comment": "Avalanche danger rises from low to moderate during the course of the day. Main problem: wet snow. Many extremely steep rocky slopes have already discharged. Where there is still sufficient snow, esp. on the shady side and at high altitudes, it can trigger naturally as loose snow avalanches or be released by 1 skier. Wet-snow masses are often swept along on the plummet path. In addition, possibility of glide snow avalanches on steep grass-covered slopes and rock slabs with sufficient snow. Releases are mostly small, esp. at higher altitudes and later in the day they can grow to medium size. ",

        "comment": "In leeward high altitude terrain and under clear nocturnal skies the snowpack is melt-freeze encrusted in the morning. Elsewhere the snowpack is moist down to the ground and heavy. Due to solar radiation it forfeits further firmness during the course of the day. Where the water seeps down to and accumulates at the ground, gliding movements over smooth ground are promoted. Low-altitude south-facing slopes are becoming increasingly bare of snow."
