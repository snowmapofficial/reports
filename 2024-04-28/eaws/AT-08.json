Frequency and size of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. In case of extended bright intervals, medium-sized loose-snow avalanches are possible, possibly endangering exposed zones. Activities in outlying terrain demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. Danger rises during the course of each day due to warmth and solar radiation. Isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible. Increasing glide-snow avalanches on smooth grass-covered slopes which previously were bare. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",
