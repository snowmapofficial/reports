        "comment": "Small and medium-sized natural avalanches are possible in particular on very steep sunny slopes. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on a crust in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. Adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. Wind slabs can in some places be released by a single winter sport participant and reach medium size. Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
        "highlights": "From the early morning as a consequence of solar radiation there will be an increase in the danger of moist avalanches. Fresh and older wind slabs in the high Alpine regions."

As a consequence of rising temperatures and solar radiation a crust will form on the surface during the next few days. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be reduced over a wide area."
