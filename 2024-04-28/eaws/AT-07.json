Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> During the day: <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of wet avalanches being released will increase gradually especially on extremely steep sunny slopes. Especially on extremely steep sunny slopes small to medium-sized wet loose snow avalanches are possible.

These avalanche prone locations are to be found on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2600 m. Mostly avalanches are small. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> During the day: <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of wet avalanches being released will increase gradually especially on extremely steep sunny slopes. Especially on extremely steep sunny slopes small to medium-sized wet loose snow avalanches are possible. This also applies in isolated cases on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m. <br/> <br/> In addition further gliding avalanches are possible. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
