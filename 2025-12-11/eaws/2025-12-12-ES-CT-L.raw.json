Individual small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist snow slides during the day being released will increase a little on very steep sunny slopes. They can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Southern border of Aran, High Alpine regions: The more recent wind slabs are mostly small and can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Friday: The weather will be sunny. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"The avalanche danger will persist.","tendencyType":"steady","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-12-12T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-13T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-12-12"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["NE","SW","NW","N","W","S","SE","E"]},{"problemType":"wet_snow","elevation":{},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"loose"}},"aspects":["SW","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"3293dd41-8d4d-4e30-8ba9-181e3a5a3342","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
