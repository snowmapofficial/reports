        "comment": "A great many small and medium-sized gliding avalanches have been released last week. <br/> As the temperature drops there will be a gradual decrease in the danger of gliding avalanches. Individual small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized avalanches are further not ruled out. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist snow slides during the day being released will increase a little on very steep sunny slopes. They can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> <br/> Southern border of Aran, High Alpine regions: The more recent wind slabs are mostly small and can only be released in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> During the day: Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",
