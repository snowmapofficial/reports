As a result of daytime warming and solar radiation, generally only small wet-snow avalanches are possible.  Small glide-snow avalanches continue to trigger naturally on steep, smooth-ground slopes which have not yet discharged."

Nocturnal outgoing radiation is adequate particularly in the latter part of the night, the snowpack can consolidate superficially. During the course of the day, it softens up especially on sunny slopes and at lower altitudes and the danger of wet-snow avalanches again rises. On shady high-altitude slopes above 2400m, weak layers are still evident inside the snowpack."
