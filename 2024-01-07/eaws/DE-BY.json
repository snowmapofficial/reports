        "comment": "Above 1500 m avalanche danger in the Allg\u00e4u, Ammergau, Werdenfels, and Berchtengaden Alps is considerable; below that altitude it is low. Fresh snowdrift accumulations are the main problem. Danger zones occur esp. in steep ridgeline terrain on SE/S/NW facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Wherever the snow is bonded like a slab, caution is imperative. The frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person engaged in winter sports and can reach medium size.\r\nThe often still loose fresh snow can trigger naturally as a loose-snow avalanche in extremely steep terrain, or also be triggered by persons. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow also heed the dangers of being swept along by snow masses or of taking a fall.\r\nIn addition, isolated glide snow avalanches can be expected esp. on very steep slopes with a smooth ground beneath in all aspects natural triggering is possible. Glide cracks are covered, thus, hard to spot. At higher altitudes these releases can reach medium size.",

Bonding of fresh to old snow/snowdrifts is good at low altitudes, deteriorates with ascending altitude. In places, trigger-sensitive intermediate layers are embedded in the new snow masses. NE winds transport the loose snow very effectively; many new snowdrift accumulations will be generated which are deposited atop loose snow layers.
