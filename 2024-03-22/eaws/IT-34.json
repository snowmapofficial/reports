        "comment": "As the moisture increases individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible. In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as above the tree line wind slabs will form. <br/> The fresh wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant and generally at high altitude. <br/>",
        "highlights": "The danger of natural moist avalanches will increase during the day. As a consequence of new snow and strong wind the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent towards the evening."

Moist and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, in particular on steep slopes below approximately 2600 m, as well as at the base of rock walls above the tree line. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> The wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects at high altitude. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as in places that are protected from the wind."
