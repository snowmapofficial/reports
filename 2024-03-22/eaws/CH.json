Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places and for the most part do not contain distinct weak layers.</p><p>The snowpack is soaked up to approximately 3000 m on south-facing slopes, up to 2000-2400 m on east- and west-facing slopes, and up to approximately 1800-2000 m on north-facing slopes.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, especially on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and on north-facing slopes below approximately 2000 m.
