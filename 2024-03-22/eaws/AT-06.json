Main danger: natureally triggered glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches from steep slopes in all aspects which have not yet discharged, and can reach medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks and opening shooting cracks, esp. in regions where snowfall has been heavy the likelihood of wet loose-snow avalanches in steep rocky south-facing terrain is high. On steep north-facing slopes above 2000 m, slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person.",
