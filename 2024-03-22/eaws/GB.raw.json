        "SnowDistribution": "Very little snow below 600m but with heavy drifting at higher altitudes. Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 40 - 50 mph.",
        "Comment": "Avalanche hazard greatest where fresh snow lies on top of the old hard snowpack.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Heavy snow showers will continue overnight and through the day. The freezing level will be around 800 metres. Gale force Westerly winds will ease slightly through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Areas of unstable windslab will continue building in wind sheltered locations throughout the period. Most affected will be North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Fresh cornices above these aspects will be fragile and prone to collapse. Below 900 metres fresh snow will lie mainly on bare ground, and stability will be much better. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack has frozen in the colder conditions. Through the day areas of fresh windslab were being deposited in wind sheltered locations on mainly North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Most affected tends to be the tops of slopes and gullies. Windward aspects are scoured and stable.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowStability": "Accumulations of fresh unstable windslab will gradually develop on steep North-East through East to South aspects above 700 metres.
