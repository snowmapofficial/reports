        "comment": "As the penetration by moisture increases more wet and gliding avalanches are possible at any time. In particular on northwest, north and northeast facing slopes they can be triggered in deep layers of the snowpack and reach large size. In the other regions the avalanches can slide on the ground and reach medium size in some cases. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours should be started and concluded early. Caution is to be exercised in particular on very steep shady slopes.",

The surface of the snowpack will freeze very little and will soften quickly. Moisture can reach the persistent weak layers buried within the snowpack and reactivate them. This applies in particular in very steep, high-altitude, shady starting zones that still retain some snow."
