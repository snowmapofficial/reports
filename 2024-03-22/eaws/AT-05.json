The drifts constitute the slab and near-surface soft layers (graupel, decomposed snow) serve as the weak layer. More deeply embedded weak layers of faceted crystals near crusts are triggerable only in isolated cases.\r\nWherever the snowpack was already moist (up to 2200 m, higher on sunny slopes) a melt-freeze crust capable of bearing loads will form during the nighttime hours. In early morning there will be firn snow."
