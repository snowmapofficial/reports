This amount already poses a threat in the form of small avalanches and landslides. The most dangerous are the couloirs, notches, places behind saddles and ridges - places where snow accumulates in larger quantities.",

The total snow cover reaches up to 60 cm in some places. The snow is still powdery in nature and is expected to become wetter, sink and lose height during the day."
