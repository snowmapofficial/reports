        "Summary": "GC 17/3 Snowpack becoming soft, moist but should remain stable. Most snow on N to E aspects above 800m. Cornices unstable. Haz Low.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Some light new snow above 650m this morning which was diminishing. Very little older snow below 750 metres on any aspect, greatest snow accumulations remain on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 800m. Predominately dry, some clouds over the summits in the morning, brighter conditions in the afternoon. Moderate to Fresh South-Easterly winds approx 10-15 mph.",
        "Comment": "Milder than of late, Sunday night until Monday afternoon mainly dry, although a few showers are possible, maybe  falling as sleet or snow above 900-1000m.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will be above the highest summits at around 1600 metres. Some overnight rain will affect the area followed by a mainly dry day. The fresh to strong South-Easterly winds will ease during the day and veer to be mainly Southerly.",
        "SnowStability": "As higher temperatures take affect and some rain affects the snowpack it will begin to soften and become moist. However, it should remain generally well bonded and stable in most locations, some localise wet snow instabilities may start to develop on steeper slopes and cornices will become unstable. Greatest snow accumulations will continue to exist mostly on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 800 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight, a light cover of new snow fell mainly above 650 metres and then a frost affected the area at all levels. Today was clear, sunny and bright particularly in the morning. Clouds did start to envelop some of the higher summits. Midday summit temperature was around -1.5 degrees celsius and winds were moderate to fresh South-Easterly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The new snow amounts that fell mainly above 650 metres are not significant. The snowpack remains generally well bonded and stable in most locations. Greatest older snow accumulations are on North to Easterly aspects mainly above 850 metres, patchy snow cover exist below this elevation, a light cover of snow is also present on some other aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "After a period of instability overnight snowpack stability will begin to improve during the day.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snowfall will clear during the middle of the night.  Strong Southerly winds will increase to storm force for a short spell overnight before easing fresh to strong.

        "SnowStability": "Overnight, unstable windslab will continue to develop on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000m. Areas most affected will be steep, convex terrain where avalanches are likely. Instabilities will be more localised between 800 and 1000m. Cornices will be fragile. Lingering snowpack weakness on steep East through South to West aspects above 1000m. During the day the snowpack will begin to consolidate and stability will gradually begin to improve. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Significant drifting above 800 metres.  Accumulations of poorly bonded windslab have developed on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.  Localised moderately bonded windslab has developed on the same aspects between 800 and 1000 metres.  Fragile cornices are building on these aspects.  Cross loading has affected West and East aspects.  Moderately bonded snow remains present on steep South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

The freezing level will climb above the summits by midnight, staying there for the rest of the period.",
        "SnowStability": "During the evening, snowfall and drifting of recent deposits will form localised windslab in wind sheltered locations on West through North to North-East aspects above 1000m. Rain and a rising freezing level will destabilise these fresh deposits overnight. By morning consolidation will be taking place and the majority of snow will be soft but generally stable with only minor surface instability being displayed in recent deposits on the steepest of terrain.
