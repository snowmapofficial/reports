        "comment": "As the moisture increases more gliding avalanches and wet snow slides are possible as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2300 m. The old wind slabs can still be released in isolated cases, especially at their margins, in particular on very steep, little used north facing slopes and at elevated altitudes. In very isolated cases they are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours, off-piste skiing and ascents to alpine cabins should be concluded early.",

In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 70 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitude snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
