        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs of last week can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong southwesterly wind, further wind slabs will form during the course of the night adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack on shady slopes. Especially transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack: Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released very easily. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes they are sometimes large. Remotely triggered and natural avalanches are to be expected. <br/> <br/> In particular steep sunny slopes: As a consequence of solar radiation moist snow slides are to be expected, even medium-sized ones. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. Restraint is advisable on this first sunny day after a long period of poor weather. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
