At 1500 metres around 2 degrees at noon, at 2000 metres around 0 degrees.\nOn Saturday, clouds and fog will predominate. It will snow a little in places, but it will be dry most of the time. The sun will only come out occasionally, more in the afternoon than in the morning. At 1500 metres around -1 degrees, at 2000 metres around -3 degrees."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk remains moderate in some areas above the tree line. Attention must still be paid to steep slopes adjacent to the ridgeline, transitions, terrain edges and steep bowls and gullies, especially in the northern and eastern sectors. Slab avalanches of up to medium size can still be triggered here in places even with low additional loads. Avoid small-scale fresh drifts caused by southerly winds, especially at higher elevations."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The partly unstable old snowpack still contains easily accessible weak layers such as faceted crystals and/or floating snow. This means that slab avalanches can easily be triggered here. Depending on the aspect and hardness, the snowpack varies in hardness on the surface, sometimes icy. Mostly at higher altitudes, there may still be small-scale, disruptive drifts. In general, there is little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."
