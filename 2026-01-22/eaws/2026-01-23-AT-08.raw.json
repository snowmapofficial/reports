If a release sweeps away the entire snowpack the avalanche can grow to medium size. Danger zones are located expecially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers. In addition, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been generated particularly in ridgline and pass areas."

In addition, older snowdrift accumulations on shady high-altitude slopes can be prone to triggering in places. As wind velocity increases, small snowdrifts will accumulate afresh in ridgeline and pass areas."

Small-sized avalanches can in isolated cases be triggered even by minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur most often in transition zones from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution."
