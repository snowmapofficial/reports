Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations can be found at the transition from little to much snow, for example when entering gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes.",

The snowpack base consists mainly of faceted crystals. The snow surfaces are very varied, sometimes crust can form due to wind or heat, often dominated by thin breakable crust, at the highest altitudes the snow is sometimes soft on shady slopes. Some small-scale wind slab can develop at high altitudes. The snow depths are below average."
