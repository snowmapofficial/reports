Attention must still be paid to steep slopes adjacent to the ridgeline, transitions, terrain edges and steep bowls and gullies, especially in the northern and eastern sectors. Slab avalanches of up to medium size can still be triggered here in places even with low additional loads. Avoid small-scale fresh drifts caused by southerly winds, especially at higher elevations.",

This means that slab avalanches can easily be triggered here. Depending on the aspect and hardness, the snowpack varies in hardness on the surface, sometimes icy. Mostly at higher altitudes, there may still be small-scale, disruptive drifts. In general, there is little snow and it is distributed very differently. In addition to completely blown away areas, there are also well-filled areas."
