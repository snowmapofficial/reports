        "comment": "The avalanche risk is low. In below-average snow conditions, there are only individual avalanche prone locations in extremely steep, on shady slopes above the tree line. Small slab avalanches can be triggered here, especially under high additional load. The risk of falling in steep gullies and in steep, partly icy areas adjacent to the ridgeline, crest or summit is higher than the risk of burial.",

On shady slopes, the thin snow surface is crusted can form and hard, sometimes icy. At higher altitudes it is mostly blown off, only in areas sheltered from the wind is there a little more snow. In extremely steep gullies on shady slopes, angular shapes can weaken the snow base, fundament. Above this, however, there is usually only a little snow."

In the lowlands there will be some thick fog with an upper limit around 1000 metres above sea level.\nThe temperature at an altitude of 1900 metres will be around -3 degrees. The temperature at an altitude of 1500 metres is between -4 and 0 degrees. In the Ybbstal Alps there will be moderate winds from the south-west, from the Schneeberg to the Hochwechsel the wind will be brisk to strong with gusts of up to 60 km/h from the south-west. No new fallen snow is expected."
