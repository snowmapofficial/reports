Persistent showery rainfall below 800m sleet and snow above with snow becoming persistent on the tops later.  Winds gale to storm force East-South-Easterly.\nObservedSnowStability: Significantly diminished snow cover on all aspects. There is a moist and generally stable snowpack at lower elevations with the snowline around 700m.
