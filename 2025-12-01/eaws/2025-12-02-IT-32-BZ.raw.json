The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2400 m. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In isolated cases avalanches can also be released in near-ground layers, in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Steep, glaciated terrain must also be critically assessed. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"A little snow is lying.
