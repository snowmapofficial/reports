        "SnowDistribution": "A variable snowpack spanning the entire spectrum from low elevation slush to snow ice above 1050 metres.  Good visibility.  Winds approx 10mph or less at plateau height.",
        "Comment": "Remaining wintery at higher elevations.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight precipitation, falling as snow down to 900 metres will clear to leave a mainly dry day.  South-East winds will gradually veer becoming South-West by dawn.  These winds will increase during the day to reach Gale force by noon.  The freezing level will lower to 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will gradually build on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres.  Areas most affected will be steep, wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire headwalls.  Fragile cornices will start to build on these same aspects.  Elsewhere snow stability will remain good with a continued thaw at lower elevations.   The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "An unsettled evening with storm force winds and mild temperatures cleared to leave a calm, dry day.  Light South-Westerly summit winds with the freezing level around 1200 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack has started to consolidate in the mild temperatures and is generally stable in all locations.  Greatest accumulations can be found above 900 metres mainly in the high coires with a Northerly aspect and in wind sheltered locations on high plateaus.  A significant loss of snow at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Winds are expected to be moderate South-Easterly this evening, overnight veering South-Westerly and strengthening to gale force. Showers are expected throughout the night and into the morning, falling as snow above 900 metres. The freezing level is expected to be around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will be deposited in wind sheltered areas, mainly on North-West through North to East aspects above 1000 metres. Western aspects will also be affected this evening. Fragile cornices will build above North-West through North to East aspects. On other aspects and at lower elevations the snowpack will be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

This was consolidating during the day. Greatest accumulations of the older snow lie on North to East aspects mainly above 1000m. Some small cornices are present above these aspects.
