Dangerous can be places where the slope changes abruptly, in narrow moguls, troughs and under rock walls. In the northern sector, the powdery nature of the snow still persists, lying on older hard ground. Great care should be taken in places where the powder surface changes to a windblown slab.",

In the north, in shady locations and where there was less wind influence, the snow is powdery. The total snow depth in our mountains is 10-120 cm."
