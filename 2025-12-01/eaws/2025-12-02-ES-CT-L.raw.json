They are barely recognisable. Stability tests and field observations indicate the existence of a weak snowack on very steep shady slopes. In isolated cases the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> Also extremely steep shady slopes: As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides are possible."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Up to 5 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell on Sunday above approximately 1500 m. The fresh snow of recent weeks and the sometimes deep wind slabs are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in some places in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2100 m. Faceted weak layers exist in the bottom section of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall until Wednesday. Significant increase in danger of dry avalanches as a consequence of the snowfall.
