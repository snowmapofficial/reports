        "comment": "Above the treeline avalanche danger is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main problem: fresh, trigger-prone snowdrifts on E/W facing slopes. Slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person in the fresh fallen snow, releases medium-sized. In addition, in extended north-facing terrain, older snowdrift masses from the weekend can still trigger slab avalanches by large additional loading. Beware esp. the entries into steep gullies and bowls, also behind discontinuities, the strong winds can form trigger-prone snowdrift accumulations also in wooded zones. In isolated cases below open glide cracks on steep smooth slopes, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches can be expected. Avoid these zones.",

Both in transitions to the old snopack and inside the fresh snowdrifts there are weak layers. The snowpack base is often moist, tends to glide over steep smooth ground."
