After a significant cooling associated with snowfall and very strong winds, 5 to 15 cm of new snow fell (Monday) over the tree-line. The snow is being blown by the wind onto the leeward slopes, especially in the E, SE and S orientations, where it can reach a thickness of more than 30 cm.  On steep slopes, in troughs, under saddles and under rock walls, there are therefore snow slabs and pillows that are not sufficiently bonded with the former surface. Avalanche release in these areas is possible, especially with high additional loads.",

It fell during the warm SW flow until it got significantly colder on Sunday evening.  On Tuesday we expect sunny weather with only light winds, sunlit slopes will quickly stabilise.
