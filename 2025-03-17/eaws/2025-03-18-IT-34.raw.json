On very steep shady slopes the avalanches can penetrate down to the ground and reach large size. <br/> Avalanches can be released by a single winter sport participant, in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Whumpfing sounds and natural avalanches serve as an alarm sign. <br/> In the regions exposed to a lot of new snow caution is to be exercised in particular on wind-loaded slopes. <br/> Up to 2200 m rain fell in the last two days over a wide area. More medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large moist and wet avalanches are possible. Bases of rock walls are especially dangerous. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection."
