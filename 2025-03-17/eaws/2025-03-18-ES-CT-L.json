        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate wind from southeasterly directions, avalanche prone wind slabs formed since Sunday adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In the course of the day the previously small wind slabs will increase in size appreciably. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and very easily released. In particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> <br/> Faceted weak layers exist in the centre of the old snowpack in particular on rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. These can be released in particular in little used backcountry terrain. <br/> <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection.",
        "highlights": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Weak layers in the old snowpack are treacherous."

In the past few hours the wind was moderate in some localities in particular at the southern border of Aran. On Tuesday it will be partly cloudy. The wind will be moderate to strong in particular at the southern and eastern borders of Aran. The southeasterly wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> <br/> Over a wide area new snow and wind slabs are lying on old snow containing large grains. The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack."
