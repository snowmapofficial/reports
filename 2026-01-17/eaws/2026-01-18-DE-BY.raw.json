      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is moderate above 1600 metres and low below that. The main problem is a persistent weak layer. Dry slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by a small additional load. Avalanche prone locations are at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, especially on snowy eastern and northern slopes.\n\nIn addition, wet snow can occasionally become problematic during the daytime changes. Small, wet avalanches can detach themselves, especially when exposed to sunlight in very steep, extreme terrain."

      "comment" : "The snow cover, snowpack is increasingly settling in mild temperatures. In places, old snow packs lie on a crust of melted snow, in the area of which there are weak, built-up layers. At high altitudes, the snowpack base consists of faceted crystals. The snow surface is dominated by breakable crust up to medium elevations, and cardboard snow in the forest. On the sunny slopes, it is increasingly icy in the morning and firns up again in parts during the daytime changes."
