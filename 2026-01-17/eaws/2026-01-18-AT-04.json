        "comment": "The avalanche danger is classified as moderate above the tree line. Only rarely could there be transportable snow. If there is fresh wind slab (strong southerly wind) in the extended northern sector, this is very prone to triggering and should therefore be avoided. There are still avalanche prone locations in extreme terrain (areas adjacent to the ridgeline, crests or summits, bowls and gullies) at high altitudes where weak layers in the old snowpack could be addressed, in particular due to large, sometimes small additional loads. Possible avalanches are mostly small to medium-sized.",

The old snowpack therefore contains layers with faceted crystals and/or floating snow. At high altitudes, fresh small-scale but very easily disturbed snowdrift accumulations could only form where transportable snow occurs. The snow depths are still very below average."
