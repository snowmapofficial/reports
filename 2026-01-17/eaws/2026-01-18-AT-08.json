In addition, one single winter sports enthusiast can trigger slab avalanches in the old snow. If these sweep away the entire snowpack, they can grow to medium size. Danger zones are found especially on steep shady slopes, but also occur in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures in the snowpack surface are alarm signals. Also remote triggerings continue to be possible. Activities in backcountry, away from secured ski runs, demand experience in evaluating the terrain and assessing avalanche dangers.",
