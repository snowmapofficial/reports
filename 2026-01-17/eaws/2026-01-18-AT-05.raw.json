Avalanche prone locations are concentrated in the north-west, north to east facing steep terrain, but also in the southern sector, behind terrain edges and in gullies and bowls. They increase rapidly in size and frequency with altitude. The wind slabs are often located directly next to blown-off areas, are easily recognisable and should be avoided at all costs. Cracks and whumpfing collapsing sounds when walking on the snow cover, snowpack are a sign of danger."

Further weak layers of faceted crystals and deep rime lie in the persistent weak layer below and can occasionally be activated by surface avalanches. The total snow depth is still well below average in many places. Broad ridge and ridges are often completely blown off."
