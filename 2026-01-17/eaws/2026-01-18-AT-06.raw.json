Along the northern slopes of the Niedere Tauern and in the northern Alps, southerly foehn winds will ensure clear conditions. On Sunday, the mountains on the southern side of the Alps will quickly clear above an altitude of around 1200 metres, with the sun coming out at lower altitudes around midday. The northern Alps will be cloudless all day with good visibility. Along the main Tauern ridge and in the Limestone Alps there will be brisk to stormy south to south-easterly winds.\nThe temperature at an altitude of 2000 metres is between -2 and 1 degree. The temperature at an altitude of 1500 metres is around 3 degrees. Strong winds with gusts of around 80 km/h from the south."

Avalanche prone locations are in the east and north sectors, especially behind ridgelines, terrain edges and in steep gullies and bowls (persistent weak layer problem!). Slab avalanches can occasionally be triggered at the avalanche prone locations by even small additional loads and can reach medium size."

      "comment" : "Most of the snow cover, snowpack has settled. The snow layering is currently not changing significantly. In the high altitudes, older wind slab lies on angular forms in the northern and eastern exposures.  Weak layers are mainly found in the old snowpack (unstable layer of faceted crystals). In the foundation of the snow cover, kinetic metamorphism (floating snow) weakens the stability. On the sunny slopes, the snowpack is again becoming more stable.\nDue to the wind from the south, fresh snowdrift accumulations are forming occasionally in the high alpine regions (Schladminger Tauern - Dachstein), especially above 2300 metres.\nSnow depths are still below average."
