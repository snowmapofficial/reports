        "comment": "The avalanche danger is low. In extremely steep shady slopes above the tree line, small slab avalanches cannot be completely ruled out. The risk of injury and falling generally outweighs the risk of burial. In general, be careful in the hardness or icy entrance areas to steep gullies. Especially in the extended northern exposures, fresh, thin snowdrift accumulations can cover the icy areas.",

In extremely steep shady-slope gullies, the snow base, fundament can be partially weakened by angular shapes, but these areas are rare. In general, the snow cover is below average, with often only a few centimetres of snow covering the ground below the tree line."

Temperatures at 1500 metres will be between minus 1 and plus 1 degree, but the wind will make it feel colder."
