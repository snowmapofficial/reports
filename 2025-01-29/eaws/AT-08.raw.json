Danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude, particularly on steep shady slopes, behind protruberances in the landscape and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls.  Activities in backcountry demand experience in avalanche danger assessment. At lower altitudes, danger is moderate. Due to higher temperatures, loose-snow slides and increasingly frequent small glide-snow avalanches are possible on sunny slopes."

The most recent bout of fresh snow and drifts is only poorly bonded with the soft snowpack surface on high-altitude shady steep slopes, often the snowdrifts have been blanketed by fresher snowfall. On sunny slopes the most recent snowfall is well bonded, the old snowpack beneath it is well consolidated. At lower altitudes the fresh snow often fell on bare ground."
