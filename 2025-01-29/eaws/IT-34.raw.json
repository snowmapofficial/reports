      "comment" : "The snow sport conditions outside marked and open pistes are to some extent precarious. Even single skiers can release avalanches, including large ones. The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack. In the regions exposed to a lot of new snow caution is to be exercised in particular on steep shady slopes. The snowpack will be in most cases subject to considerable local variations. The avalanche prone locations are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. As a consequence of solar radiation, the natural avalanche activity will rapidly increase."

      "comment" : "As a consequence of new snow and a strong to storm force wind from southwesterly directions, deep wind slabs formed by Tuesday in all aspects. They are lying on soft layers on shady slopes. The fresh wind slabs are lying on top of a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on west to north to east facing aspects. This applies in particular above the tree line. <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Distinct weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places even by individual winter sport participants on shady slopes."
