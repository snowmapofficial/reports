Danger zones tend to increase with ascending altitude, particularly on steep shady slopes, behind protruberances in the landscape and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls.  Activities in backcountry demand experience in avalanche danger assessment. At lower altitudes, danger is moderate. Due to higher temperatures, loose-snow slides and increasingly frequent small glide-snow avalanches are possible on sunny slopes.",
