In a few places the snowdrifts can be triggered as medium-sized slab avalanches even by minimal additional loading. Avalanche prone locations are found in steep ridgeline terrain in W/N/SE aspects as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. In extremely steep sun-exposed terrain, small loose-snow avalanches can release naturally. Isolated small glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on very steep slopes with smooth ground.",
