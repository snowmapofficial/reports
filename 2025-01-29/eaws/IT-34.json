The snowpack will be in most cases subject to considerable local variations. The avalanche prone locations are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. As a consequence of solar radiation, the natural avalanche activity will rapidly increase.",

This applies in particular above the tree line. <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Distinct weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places even by individual winter sport participants on shady slopes."
