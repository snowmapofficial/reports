On very steep slopes with smooth ground and grass-covered terrain and forest clearances, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night. Releases mostly medium size. Avoid zones beneath glide cracks.\r\nSmall-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading at high altitudes. The few danger zones occur in transition from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into steep gullies.\r\nDue to solar radiation and mild temperatures, in addition, wet loose-snow avalanches trigger naturally as the day unfolds in steep rocky terrain.",
