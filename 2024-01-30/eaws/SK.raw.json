The most dangerous will be sunlit slopes of S orientation with more accumulated snow and high gradients.\nSmaller spontaneous avalanches are also likely to occur during the day."

At 1500-2200m above sea level, the air temperature is expected to stay above 0°C throughout the night from Tuesday to Wednesday.\nThe snow cover is blown to a hard base of ice on the windward, western sides due to the very windy weekend.\nPillows of wind-blown snow that are in east to southwest exposures are melting, and may become loose on the hard ground. At the same time, warming causes the top layer of snow cover to melt."
