        "SnowDistribution": "Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Limited snow cover, remnants above 800 metres.",
        "Comment": "Stormy Wednesday, with summit snows at times. Becoming more wintry at the weekend.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "South-Westerly winds will be very strong to storm force at summit levels overnight and during the day. Some showers, heavy at times will provide snow cover on the highest tops during Tuesday evening and overnight, then rain at all levels during the morning before snow showers return in late afternoon above 400 metres. Freezing level at 1000 metres overnight, then well above tops towards midday, then lowering to 600 metres during the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Some new snow on the highest tops expected but will not be significant in depth. Old snow remnants will be firm and stable and confined to North to Easterly aspects above 800 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A blustery day with strengthening South-Westerly winds. Occasional showers providing a dusting of snow on the highest tops, especially inland from the coastal ranges.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The limited and depleted snowpack remains firm and stable, with greatest amounts mainly on Northerly to Easterly aspects above 800 metres. A dusting of new snow lies on the eastern tops of the area, but insignificant in amount. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

Storm force South-South-Westerly winds becoming gale force Westerly in the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will develop through the day on North through East to South-East aspects, mainly above 950 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire rims will be most affected. Fragile cornices will develop above these locations.

A few snow showers are possible during the evening above 800 metres. Precipitation is expected during the day, falling initially as snow on the summits then turning to sleet or rain at most levels around midday as the freezing level rises to above the summits. During the afternoon precipitation will turn back to snow as the freezing level quickly drops to around 600 metres.",

Severe gale force South-Westerly winds during the morning, will ease slightly as they veer Westerly during the afternoon.",

Later, shallow accumulations of windslab will be deposited in steep, wind sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 850 metres. These are expected to be isolated and avoidable.
