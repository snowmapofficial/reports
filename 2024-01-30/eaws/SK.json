        "comment": "For all mountain ranges of Slovakia a moderate avalanche danger is declared, i.e. 2 degree from the 5-part international scale.\nDangerous are formations of wind-blown snow on very steep slopes oriented E to SW.\nTemperatures above freezing cause the risk of avalanches from wet snow, which can be released especially under high additional loads. The most dangerous will be sunlit slopes of S orientation with more accumulated snow and high gradients.\nSmaller spontaneous avalanches are also likely to occur during the day."

At the same time, warming causes the top layer of snow cover to melt."
