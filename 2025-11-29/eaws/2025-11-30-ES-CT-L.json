        "comment": "The wind slabs of last week are poorly bonded with the old snowpack. Weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack can be released by people especially on steep, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds have confirmed the unfavourable bonding of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> In addition on south and southwest facing slopes, small gliding avalanches are possible.",
