Weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack can be released by people especially on steep, rather lightly snow-covered shady slopes. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Released avalanches and whumpfing sounds have confirmed the unfavourable bonding of the snowpack. <br/> <br/> In addition on south and southwest facing slopes, small gliding avalanches are possible."},"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"On Sunday it will be very cloudy. Some snow will fall until midday over a wide area. The fresh snow of last week as well as the sometimes deep wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2100 m. Shady slopes intermediate and high altitudes: Faceted weak layers exist deeper in the snowpack. <br/> <br/> <br/> In particular sunny slopes and low and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze and will hardly soften at all. <br/> In particular at elevated altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."},"tendency":[{"highlights":"Gradual increase in danger of moist avalanches as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation.","tendencyType":"increasing","validTime":{"startTime":"2025-11-30T16:00:00Z","endTime":"2025-12-01T16:00:00Z"}}],"customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2025-11-30"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"avalancheProblems":[{"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2100"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"poor","frequency":"some","avalancheSize":2,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"aspects":["NE","NW","W","N","E"]},{"problemType":"gliding_snow","elevation":{"lowerBound":"1800"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day","snowpackStability":"very_poor","frequency":"few","avalancheSize":1,"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"glide"}},"aspects":["SW","W","S","SE","E"]}],"bulletinID":"27d158fd-02d7-4cf8-8263-2b1b9191f0c2","dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2100"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2100"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","regions":[{"name":"Southern limit of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-02"},{"name":"South slope of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-03"},{"name":"North and center of Aran","regionID":"ES-CT-L-01"}]}]}
