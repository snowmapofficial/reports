The wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Avalanches can reach medium size. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can in isolated cases penetrate near-ground layers of the snowpack and reach quite a large size, in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, as well as in gullies and bowls. Steep, glaciated terrain must also be critically assessed. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information that has been collected in the field, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
