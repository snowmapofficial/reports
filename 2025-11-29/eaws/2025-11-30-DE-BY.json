On smooth ground, for example on steep meadow slopes, in forest aisles and on rock slabs, sliding snow avalanches can release themselves at any time of day or night. Medium-sized avalanches are possible.\nAt higher altitudes, weak layers in old snow can be problematic. Slab avalanches can be triggered here on shaded steep slopes, especially with high additional loads. Avalanches can reach medium size and be sufficient for burial.",
