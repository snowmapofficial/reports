Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Avalanches can in isolated cases penetrate near-ground layers of the snowpack and reach quite a large size, in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m, as well as in gullies and bowls.
