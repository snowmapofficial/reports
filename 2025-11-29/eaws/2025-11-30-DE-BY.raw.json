On smooth ground, for example on steep meadow slopes, in forest aisles and on rock slabs, sliding snow avalanches can release themselves at any time of day or night. Medium-sized avalanches are possible.\nAt higher altitudes, weak layers in old snow can be problematic. Slab avalanches can be triggered here on shaded steep slopes, especially with high additional loads. Avalanches can reach medium size and be sufficient for burial."

On the sunny side, the snow will soften again on the surface during the course of the day. At higher altitudes, well-set powder snow dominates. Here on shady slopes, especially in hollows and in the area of older drift snow accumulations, layers of angular crystals have been preserved deep in the snowpack in places. The ground is not frozen and the base of the snowpack is often wet."
