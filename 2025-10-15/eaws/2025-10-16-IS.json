Snow is considered mostly stable but small wet avalanches can still release where most solar radiation occurs and in heavy thaw. People travelling in mountains should still be careful in steep snow-covered slopes. If new snow falls on the spring melting snow, the stability could decrease temporarily. The next avalanche bulletin will be published the 15th October. Specialists on duty will be focused on landslide hazard, but avalanches will be documented if they are reported. Please contact the Met Office via telephone 522-6000 to report landslides or avalanches or with an email to skriduvakt@vedur.is.&nbsp;",
