At elevated altitudes the avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent and exist in all aspects. Avalanches can in some cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> More gliding avalanches are possible, even quite large ones, in particular on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m, in particular in the regions with a lot of snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> On extremely steep slopes more small to medium-sized wet loose snow avalanches are possible as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation.",
