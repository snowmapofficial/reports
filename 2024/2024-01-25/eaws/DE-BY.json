Wet glide snow avalanches can release at any time on smooth grass-covered slopes with still enough snow. They are generally small; however, medium-sized avalanches cannot be excluded. Due to rainfall, smaller wet loose snow avalanches can also release on very steep slopes.\r\nAt highest summits also beware snowdrifts, in particular on steep N/E/S-facing ridgeline slopes.

Small snowdrifts are generated. In places, weak layers can exist within the fresh and older snowdrifts. The older snowdrifts bond in most places well with the moist to wet old snowpack surface. Frequently the snow cover is wet down to the ground, resulting in gliding movements over the smooth ground. Melt-freeze crusts and marked boundary layers are disintegrating more and more. At lower altitudes and on wind-exposed crests the ground is becoming increasingly bare. Below 1400 m there is barely any snow left.\r\n"

These can be triggered as slab avalanches even by the weight of one sole skier. Avalanche prone locations occur in steep ridgeline terrain in N-E-S aspects, in places also distant from ridgelines behind slope discontinuities as well as in gullies and bowls. Frequency and size of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. Avalanches tend to be to medium-sized.\r\nAdditionally possibility of glide snow avalanches on steep grass-covered slopes at any time. Below 1500 m they are generally small; above that altitude they can reach medium size, in isolated cases they can reach large size in the Allg\u00e4u.  In addition, smaller wet loose snow avalanches can also release on very steep slopes due to rainfall.",
