Here sometimes deep wind slabs formed. These are lying on weak layers in particular on very steep north, northeast and northwest facing slopes. <br/> The soft wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> On steep slopes and at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain natural dry avalanches are possible, even large ones in isolated cases.",
