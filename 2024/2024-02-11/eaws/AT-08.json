        "comment": "In high ridgeline terrain, in gullies and bowls, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require special attentiveness: they are often blanketed by fresher snowdrifts and are trigger-prone. Danger zones increase with ascending altitude. One winter sports enthusiast can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche. Apart from the dangers of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall also need consideration. Beware cornices on ridges. Glide-snow avalanches are difficult to forecast or estimate. They can trigger in all aspecdts below 2600 m at any time of day or night and grow to medium size. Due to lower temperatures, the danger of superficial wet-snow avalanches has receded.",

        "comment": "As a result of 10-15 cm more\u00a0fresh snow plus wind impact, additional small-sized snowdrift accumulations have been generated. Fresh snow and small snowdrifts lie deposited atop a stable old snowpack surface. Fresh drifts at high-alpine altitudes have weak layers in the uppermost part of the snowpack, often trigger-prone. The warm ground and wet snowpack base reinforce gliding snowpack movements. Below 1400 m there is very little snow on the ground."
