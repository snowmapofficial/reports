        "comment": "Avalanche danger in the Bavarian Alps is low. Gliding snow is the main problem. On very steep slopes with smooth ground  in all aspects, isolated naturally triggered glide-snow releases (small-to-medium) are possible. Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger.\r\nApart from that, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations can trigger a small slab even by minimum additional loading. Danger zones occur above the timberline near near ridges on north and east-facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude. Danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow from avalanches.",
