The strong wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> In these regions and at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is slightly greater. <br/> The fresh wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant on steep north, east and south facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. Meticulous route selection is appropriate. <br/> On very steep slopes medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are possible as a consequence of the sometimes storm force northwesterly wind.",
