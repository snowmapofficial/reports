In high/high-alpine regions snowdrifts can trigger a slab (small-to-medium), most danger zones are easily recognized, lie neaer to and distant from ridges, behind discontinuities and in gullies. Most danger zones are on NW/N/SE facing steep slopes, also on south-facing slopes in high-alpine terrain. Above 2400 m, esp. on shady slopes, weak layers can be triggered by large additional loading and releases occasionally grow to large size.",

The snowpack is highly irregular due to storm impact. The snowpack is quite irregular. Possible weak layer for a slab or loose-snow avalanches: faceted crystals on the melt-freeze layer above 2400 m. The old snowpack has been repeatedly made wet up 2000 m, most recently from rain impact. Gliding snow activity is currently low."
