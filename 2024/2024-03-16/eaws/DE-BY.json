Wet glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in steep terrain in all aspects, releases mostly small, occasionally medium-sized. In addition, on extremely steep rough and rocky slopes in all aspects, small wet loose-snow avalanches are possible, triggerable by winter sports enthusiasts in very steep terrain. Beware the risks of being swept along.",
