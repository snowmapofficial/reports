        "Summary": "Localised new windslab NE to SE aspects above 900m growing in extent later. Moderate Hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack.  A day of flat light and no definition.  Winds approx 50 - 60 mph progress very difficult with potential to be taken off your feet.",
        "Comment": "Showery nature of snowfall means our area may get slightly more or less than forecasted. Adjust avalanche forecast accordingly when on site.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Rain turning to snow showers by midnight and continuing for the rest of the day. Much colder. Strong Westerly airflow.",
        "SnowStability": "The surface of the old snowpack will freeze and become crusty or firm. New weak windslab will form on steep North-East to South-East facing aspects above 900m. Initially localised, new windslab will become a little more widespread later. Minor new cornice development anticipated over steepest lee slopes and gullies.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Mild, wet and windy.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is moist or wet but well stabilized in most locations. Main old snow accumulations are on North through East to South aspects above 800m. One or two residual cornices in places above a few selected North- East to East aspects.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing wet snowpack, wet accumulations persisting above 850 metres.  Poor visibility throughout the day above 600 metres.  Strong to gale force South-Westerly winds 35-55 mph with some stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Colder conditions and new snow but remaining quite windy.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, rain giving way to drier conditions for a few hours and the freezing level lowering to around 800 metres. Snow showers commencing during the early hours of the morning falling mainly above 700 metres and continuing for most of the day. Winds will be strong to gale force from a Westerly direction.",
        "SnowStability": "New, poorly bonded, shallow windslab accumulations will form mainly on North-East to South-East aspects above 850 metres. These new deposits are not expected to be deep or extensive and should be avoidable. Steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire rims will be most affected. Fragile cornices will start to develop above these locations. Elsewhere the older moist snowpack will refreeze to become firm and icy.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The freezing level was well above the summits. Around midday at 1100 metres it was plus 4.2 degrees celsius.  Rain fell at all levels accompanied by gale force South-Westerly winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is wet at all levels. Small areas of localised wet snow instabilities are present mainly on North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations, gully tops and coire rims are most affected. Cornices are unstable. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "The existing snowpack will begin to refreeze and be well bonded and stable throughout. Localised accumulations of fresh unstable windslab will develop very gradually through the day mostly on steep North-East and East aspects, above 950 metres. Accumulations will generally be shallow and affect wind sheltered areas such as gullies and coire rims. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
