      "comment" : "In the High and Western Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger above 2000 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially the leeward sides of ridges, narrow couloirs and places under rock walls are dangerous. Particularly in these places there may be wind-blown slabs of varying hardness. They can be loosened, especially on steep slopes with high additional loads. Particularly dangerous are S, SE and E orientations. Small to medium sized slab avalanches are a risk in combination with terrain traps. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",
      "highlights" : "Watch out for wind-slabs on leeward sides. At the highest elevations there may be locally more new snow."

At the highest altitudes, particularly in narrow couloirs and on the leeward sides of ridges, there may be a large amount of new snow, which poses a potential risk when loaded.
