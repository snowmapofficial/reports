This applies in particular in the regions of the north exposed to the foehn wind as well as along the border with France, along the border with Switzerland. <br/> Since Tuesday small wind slabs formed adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at high altitude. On Wednesday these will increase in size moderately. They can be released, even by a single winter sport participant, especially on very steep slopes. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> Loose snow avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small.
