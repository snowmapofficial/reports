        "comment": "Avalanche danger is generally low. Nonetheless, fresh and easily recognized snowdrift accumulations exist on steep slopes in extended eastern aspects, behind discontinuities and in gullies which can trigger small slab avalanches. Due to poor visibility and covering by some fresh snow, potential danger zones are difficult to recognize, In addition, small wet-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on very steep rocky slopes, the likelihood increasing as the day unfolds. On steep grass-covered slopes, isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
