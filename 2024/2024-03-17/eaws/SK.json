        "comment": "The weather during Monday will be influenced by an outbreak of high pressure. Up to 10cm of new dry snow fell during the last snowfall period. In the highest altitudes of the High Tatras (above 1900 m) there is a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree from the 5-part international scale). Strong NW winds that blew during Saturday transported snow to the SE, SW, SW and E orientations. The main avalanche problem is therefore wind blown snow.  Wind-blown pillows and slabs on the leeward sides of ridges, very steep couloirs with more new wind-blown snow lying on top of frozen old snow will be dangerous. In such places it will be possible to mechanically release an avalanche, especially with a large additional load.",
