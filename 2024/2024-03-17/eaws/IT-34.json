        "comment": "In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as in high Alpine regions deep wind slabs formed. <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant and generally above the tree line. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. <br/>",
        "highlights": "The wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The danger of natural moist avalanches will increase during the day."

        "comment": "As a consequence of warming moist and wet avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in some cases, in particular on steep sunny slopes, as well as at the base of rock walls in all altitude zones. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> The wind slabs of the last few days are to be evaluated with care and prudence on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as in places that are protected from the wind."
