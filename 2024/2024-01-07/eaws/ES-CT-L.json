        "comment": "The extensive wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects and generally at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. Sometimes avalanches are large. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. <br/> The new snow of the last few days can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 1000 m. In many cases the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are prevalent and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection.",
        "highlights": "The large quantity of fresh snow and in particular the often deep wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects."

The northwesterly wind will transport the new snow significantly. The new snow and wind slabs are lying on a crust in particular on shady slopes."
