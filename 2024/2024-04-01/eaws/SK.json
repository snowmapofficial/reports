The exceptionally warm period is followed by a sharp cooling associated with heavy precipitation. Above 1200 m there will be snowfall. Up to 20 cm of new snow may fall. The interface between new and old snow will be particularly dangerous. There is a danger especially with high additional loads. On slopes with grassy ground, in all orientations, there is also the risk of glide avalanches, which can reach large proportions.",
