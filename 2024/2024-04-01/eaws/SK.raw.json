The interface between new and old snow will be particularly dangerous. There is a danger especially with high additional loads. On slopes with grassy ground, in all orientations, there is also the risk of glide avalanches, which can reach large proportions.",

The boundary of continuous snow cover will thus fall to the aforementioned 1200 m above sea level."
