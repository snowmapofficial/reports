Overnight and through the day fresh areas of windslab will be deposited in wind-sheltered South-West to North-West aspects above 1000 metres. The greatest hazard will be where these fresh deposits accumulate on top of the old hard icy snowpack. Windward slopes will tend to be stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
