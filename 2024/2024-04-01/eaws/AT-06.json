In high-alpine zones fresh snowdrift accumulations will be generated which can be triggered by backcountry tourers, esp. on E/N facing slopes.",

The snow base is wet, the surface generally soft already in early morning, due to the expected rainfall it is becoming wetter and heavier. At high alpine altitudes it is stabilizing. As temperatures drop, fresh drifts will be generated, poorly bonding with the old snowpack."
