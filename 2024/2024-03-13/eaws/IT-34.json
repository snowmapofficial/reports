        "comment": "The wind was stronger than expected adjacent to ridgelines in all regions. In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as in high Alpine regions deep wind slabs formed. <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant and generally above the tree line. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected. In the regions with a lot of snow and on wind-loaded slopes more large avalanches are possible, in particular in case of releases originating from starting zones that still retain some snow, caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls, as well as on extremely steep sunny slopes. <br/>",
        "highlights": "The new snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 1900 m. The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to rapid softening of the snowpack over a wide area especially at intermediate altitudes."
