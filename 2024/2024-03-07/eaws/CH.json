        "comment": "<h1>Snowpack</h1><p>The moderate to strong southerly wind is causing Wednesday\u2019s loose new snow to drift. The fresh wind slabs are prone to triggering. They are growing as the day progresses. In places, this week's thick layers of new snow are still prone to triggering. Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places. However, around the crusts in the upper third of the old snowpack, layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure are deposited, in which, especially in the inneralpine regions of Grisons, avalanches have been released.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes. These may be large.</p>"
