high patches of cloud. With the zero-degree level at approximately 4000 m, it will be extremely mild for the time of year. On Sunday in particular, visibility may be obscured by Sahara dust. There will be light to moderate southwesterly winds, becoming moderate to strong in the north on Sunday. In the Alpine valleys of the north, there will be a moderate foehn wind from the south.</p><p>The danger of dry avalanches will decrease in the south, but may increase slightly in some regions in the north as a result of strong southerly winds.</p><p>The danger of wet avalanches will increase appreciably as the day progresses as a result of solar radiation and warmer daytime temperatures. More gliding avalanches are expected again. They may occur at any time and become large, and occasionally very large in the south.
