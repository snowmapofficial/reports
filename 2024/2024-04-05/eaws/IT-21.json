This applies in particular on very steep slopes below approximately 3000 m, as well as at the base of rock walls. <br/> In particular on very steep sunny slopes moist avalanches can penetrate even deep layers and reach very large size in isolated cases. In very isolated cases, the wet avalanches can reach low altitudes from starting zones where no previous releases have taken place. <br/> The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found especially on very steep slopes above approximately 2400 m. These places are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. <br/> Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be started and concluded very early.",
