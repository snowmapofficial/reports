In the north, persistent storm-force foehn winds displaced the snow for days on end. On Easter Monday in particular, the precipitation also spread to the north, especially from the Aletsch region via the Urn Alps to the Glarus Alps and also in central Grisons and Lower Engadine. On Sunday and Monday, numerous large and very large avalanches capable of reaching the valley bottom occurred in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation.
