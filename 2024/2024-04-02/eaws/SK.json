        "comment": "In the High, Western and Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger (level 2 ). After an exceptionally warm period, there has been a cooling associated with heavy precipitation. Above 1200 m it snowed. Above 1500 m, up to 25 cm of new snow fell. The interface between new and old snow is particularly dangerous. There is a danger especially with high additional loads. As the weather gradually warms up, spontaneous wet avalanches from new snow may occur below 2000 m. On slopes with grassy ground, in all orientations, there is also the risk of slippery avalanches, which can reach large dimensions.",
