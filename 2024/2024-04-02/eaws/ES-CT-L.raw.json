      "comment" : "Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes and at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions, especially at their margins. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized and in some cases easily released. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In particular at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in all aspects. Towards the evening the likelihood of avalanches being released will increase further. Sometimes the moist avalanches are medium-sized. Gliding avalanches can also occur at any time. <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for meticulous route selection. Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be concluded by around midday."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell in the last few days. The southerly wind has transported the fresh and old snow significantly. Soft weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack especially in shady places that are protected from the wind. Wednesday: Some snow will fall until the early morning in some localities. The weather will be sunny at times. Some rain will fall in the evening in some localities. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
