        "comment": "The large quantity of fresh snow of the last few days and the wind slabs formed by the wind can be released by a single winter sport participant in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. Medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large avalanches are possible. At intermediate altitudes these can release the wet old snow as well. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of slab avalanches being released will increase in particular on sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> On steep grassy slopes occasionally large gliding avalanches are possible. This applies especially on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2600 m, including on steep shady slopes below approximately 2200 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation numerous moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. This applies in particular on extremely steep sunny slopes.",
