On Easter Monday in particular, the precipitation also spread to the north, especially from the Aletsch region via the Urn Alps to the Glarus Alps and also in central Grisons and Lower Engadine. On Sunday and Monday, numerous large and very large avalanches capable of reaching the valley bottom occurred in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation.

Above approximately 2000 m, 60 to 120 cm fell widely, with up to 200 cm of snow falling in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation from Simplon via southern Goms and Bedretto to the Valle Maggia. In the north, persistent storm-force foehn winds displaced the snow for days on end. On Easter Monday in particular, the precipitation also spread to the north, especially from the Aletsch region via the Urn Alps to the Glarus Alps and also in central Grisons and Lower Engadine. On Sunday and Monday, numerous large and very large avalanches capable of reaching the valley bottom occurred in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. As the precipitation eases and the consequences of falling temperatures set in, a significant decline in avalanche activity is now expected. However, if avalanches still occur, they can become very large.</p><p>Deeper layers in the snowpack contain hardly any distinct weak layers. Below approximately 2200 m, the snowpack is wet due to the rain.</p><p>In the south, gliding avalanches are expected. These can occasionally become very large due to the high volumes of snow. Gliding avalanches are more rare in the north but they can also be large here in isolated cases.</p>"
