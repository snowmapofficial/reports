        "comment": "During Saturday, the weather in the mountains of Slovakia will be influenced by a departing wavy cold front, which will bring rain and strong winds in many places. The snowfall limit will be up to 1800 m above sea level. There is a moderate avalanche danger for the Western, High and Western Low Tatras, i.e. the second level of the 5-part international avalanche scale. The main avalanche problem will be wind-blown snow at the highest altitudes, especially in the NW, NE and S and E orientations. In such places there will be unstable slabs and pillows of wind-blown snow which will not be sufficiently bonded to the hard underlying layer of old frozen snow. Avalanche release will be possible especially on windward slopes and gullies with high gradients. On the ridges of the highest altitudes, strong winds have created massive drifts. The second avalanche problem below 1700 m a.s.l. will be wet snow, which will become heavier due to warming. The most dangerous will be slopes with visible crevasses. In these places, spontaneous foundation avalanches may also occur during the day.",
