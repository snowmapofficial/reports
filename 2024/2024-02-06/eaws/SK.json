        "comment": "In the highest altitudes of the High, Western and western part of the Low Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger, i.e. 2 degree from the 5-part international scale. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow from the last snowfall period (Sunday-Monday). Generally the snow was blown by very strong winds to lower elevations and forest, but at the highest elevations it was also deposited on the leeward SE,E and SW sides of the mountains in narrow couloirs or terrain depressions in unstable slabs and pillows. These formations can be loosened mainly by large additional loads on steep to extremely steep slopes.  A clear night will cause freezing and hardening of the snow cover, therefore a low avalanche danger (level 1) applies at lower altitudes. Only light precipitation is expected during the day, which will be of a snow-like character from middle altitudes. Due to very strong winds, drifts have formed on the ridges and may pose a danger."

The alternation of daytime plus and negative night temperatures caused the snow cover to settle and freeze, which positively influenced the stability in the snow cover. During the day, due to the cloudy weather, no intensive melting of the snow cover is expected, while precipitation in the form of rain is expected in the afternoon, but only in moderate totals. Very strong winds may cause dangerous overhanging ridges."
