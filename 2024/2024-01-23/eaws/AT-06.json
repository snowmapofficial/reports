Below 1800 m in all aspects, small-to-medium naturally triggered avalanches can be expected which can place exposed transportation routes at risk. In addition, isolated gliding snow activity and glide-snow avalanches can\u2019t be excluded. Poor visibility and stormy conditions make assessment of avalanche danger on-site far more difficult.",
