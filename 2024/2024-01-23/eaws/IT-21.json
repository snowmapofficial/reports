        "comment": "As a consequence of the strong northwesterly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form. These can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on north to east to southeast facing aspects above approximately 2400 m. The wind slabs are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and generally in the high Alpine regions. Caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. From starting zones where no previous releases have taken place in particular the avalanches can in isolated cases reach large size. In particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large avalanches are possible. This applies in particular on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2700 m, as well as on wind-loaded slopes.",
