        "comment": "Strong to stormy winds will transport the loose snow, generating trigger-prone snowdrift accumlations. Older drifts are bonding better with the surface, but with increasing altitude are still prone to triggering, esp on high-altitude shady slopes, inadequate bonding. The old snowpack below them is generally well consolidated and stable. In zones with rain impact, however, the snowpack is being weakened. The warm ground and wet lower layers are reinforcing the gliding movement of the entire snowpack."
