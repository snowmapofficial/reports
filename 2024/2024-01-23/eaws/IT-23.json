They are to be assessed with care and prudence. In particular at intermediate and high altitudes the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. <br/> The near-surface layers of the snowpack can be released even by individual winter sport participants on wind-loaded slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found also in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> On wind-loaded slopes dry loose snow avalanches are possible above approximately 2300 m, in particular in the vicinity of peaks, especially in case of releases originating from very steep starting zones that have retained the snow thus far. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. Small and medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2300 m, especially on very steep sunny slopes. <br/> In addition in areas not adjacent to ridgelines, individual medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
