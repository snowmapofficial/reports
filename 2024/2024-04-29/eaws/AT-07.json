The high temperatures as the day progresses will give rise to increasing softening of the snowpack in all aspects below approximately 2800 m, this also applies on sunny slopes in high Alpine regions. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a strong wind from southerly directions, wind slabs formed in the last few days in high Alpine regions. The weather effects brought about a substantial stabilisation of the snow drift accumulations."
