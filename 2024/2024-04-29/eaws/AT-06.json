        "comment": "Avalanche danger is subject to a daytime danger cycle. In morning, low danger prevails (although on east and south-facing slopes isolated wet loose-snow and slab avalanches can trigger already in the morning hours), then increases swiftly with rising temperatuers to moderate. The danger of moist loose-snow and slab avalanches increases during the course of the day. In extremely steep terrain naturally triggered releases are expected.",

As temperatures rise and solar radiation intensifies, the snow quickly becomes slushy and heavy, depending on aspect. No marked weak layers are evident. The slopes are becoming bare of snow."
