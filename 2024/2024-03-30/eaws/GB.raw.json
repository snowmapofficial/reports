        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable in many places, thin layer of fresh snow above 1000 metres.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds approx 10 - 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "A weak ridge of high pressure is forecast to give dry conditions for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A clear dry day with moderate East-South-Easterly winds. The freezing level will rise above the summits.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to gradually consolidate. Snowpack stability will be generally good. Minor wet snow surface instabilities possible on steep slopes exposed to the sun. Cornices becoming increasingly unstable in the milder temperatures particularly where directly in the sun. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Scattered showers fell as snow above around 900 metres on moderate South-South-Westerly winds. The freezing level was around 1100 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack is continuing to gradually consolidate and stability is generally good. Isolated instabilities that remain in shaded areas on North and North-East aspects above 1150 metres are continuing to stabilise. New snow deposits are not of significant depth and are quickly consolidating. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Overnight, in the highest locations, the snowpack will start to refreeze before starting to soften during the day. Stability will generally be good throughout but in steep sun exposed locations some surface instabilities will develop during the day. Unstable cornices will still be present on North facing coires. Loss of snow at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack.  A day of flat light and no definition at summit level.  Southerly winds approx 10 - 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "It is forecast to be a relatively fine and dry day tomorrow. As it is now late March, the sun will have the potential for some impact on South facing slopes. These slopes will soften quickly, and may develop some surface instabilities.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be dry and mainly clear overnight. Sunday will remain dry with some sunny periods. Freezing level will be at, or slightly above the highest summits throughout. However, in the clear overnight skies, surface temperatures will be cooler. Winds will be moderate and from the East or South-East.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight the snowpack will firm up due to cooler surface temperatures. Throughout Sunday it will generally consolidate and gain stability in the drier and slightly warmer conditions. The surface of the snow will quickly soften during the day where exposed to sunlight. Some sluffing and surface wet snow instability may be encountered on steep South facing slopes. Any remaining cornices will be prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Today was cloudy with occasional showers, which were heavier in the afternoon. These gave a mix of sleet and wet snow at summit level. Freezing level rose to above the summits by mid morning. Winds were mainly Southerly and light to moderate.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Precipitation was a little heavier than expected today, but only the very tops were affected by sleet and snow, mainly on Northerly aspects above 1000 metres. Amounts were not significant, and deposits were wet and generally well bonded. Overall, the snowpack is consolidating, and remains generally stable on all aspects and at all elevations. Largest remaining areas of old snow are on steep North to East slopes above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

There is some limited potential for minor full depth snow slides from low on the crags at the end of Coire Ardair during the afternoon. Falling ice may also be an objective danger at that time too. Remaining cornices will weaken later.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Some minor wet surface instability on North aspects below 850 metres as temperatures rose after light snowfall.
