        "comment": "Beware fresh and older snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes. Due to gusts reaching gale strength, further snowdrifts are being generated. Danger zones occur also distant from ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls; they increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. Medium sized avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Due to warmth and radiation, slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. on sunny slopes. Below 2600 m, glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",

Fresh and older snowdrift masses often lie deposited atop soft layers, esp. on shady slopes, and are trigger-prone. Warmth will further weaken the snowpack, esp. in wind-protected zones. Below 2000 m the old snowpack is thoroughly moist, wet down to the ground, this reinforces gliding over smooth ground. Very little snow on the ground below 1500 m."
