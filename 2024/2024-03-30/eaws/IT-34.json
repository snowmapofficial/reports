        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in particular on steep shady slopes at high altitude. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. As a consequence of warming during the day more frequent moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected. Mostly the avalanches are medium-sized. Mostly small moist and wet avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of the rain. This applies in particular on very steep slopes. On steep grassy slopes more medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible.",
