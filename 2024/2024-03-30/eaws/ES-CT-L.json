Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2400 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These places are covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> As a consequence of the snowfall, the likelihood of dry avalanches being released will increase a little in all aspects above approximately 1800 m.
