The avalanches are rather small but in many cases easily released. <br/> The mostly small wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on steep shady slopes and generally at high altitude. <br/> The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase as the day progresses. These places are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility."
