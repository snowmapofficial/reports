        "comment": "Friday: Light snowfall at intermediate altitudes. The barely recognisable wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions they have increased in size in the last few days. <br/> These can sometimes be released, even by a single winter sport participant, especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, in particular on very steep slopes above approximately 2600 m. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> As a consequence of the new snow loose snow avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases, especially on very steep slopes, and at the base of rock walls in high Alpine regions. <br/> In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",

In some localities 2 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen above approximately 2000 m. <br/> Tuesday: The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow. In some cases the various wind slabs have bonded poorly with the old snowpack. <br/> The old snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a strong melt-freeze crust. <br/> In particular at intermediate and high altitudes there is still a very large amount of snow."
