The avalanches in these loacations are only small. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
