Tonight only a bit of snowfall and little wind. The snowpack is moist-to-wet down to the ground up to high altitudes. Because ski areas are closed there is little information about snowpack layering at high altitudes. The fresh snow at lower altitudes often lies deposited atop what was previously bare ground, reinforcing gliding movement of the snowpack."
