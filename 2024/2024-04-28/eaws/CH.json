This is particularly the case in the inneralpine regions.</p><p>In the north, the incoming radiation and warm temperatures led to the layers of fresh snow from last week being largely soaked. Before last week's cold snap, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was already soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, increasingly so once again at high altitudes.</p>"
