        "comment": "As the day progresses an unfavourable avalanche situation will persist in some regions. As the moisture increases more moist snow slides and avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. Avalanches can be released by people or triggered naturally. In particular at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. <br/> <br/> The current avalanche situation calls for restraint.",

        "comment": "The avalanche conditions remain spring-like. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be reduced. The sleet will give rise towards the evening to rapid and thorough wetting of the snowpack in some cases in all aspects also at elevated altitudes. The southerly foehn wind will transport only a little snow. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 20 to 100 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At high altitudes and in high Alpine regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
