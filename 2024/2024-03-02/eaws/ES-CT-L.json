        "comment": "The large quantity of fresh snow of last week as well as the extensive wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. As a consequence of new snow and a strong northwesterly wind, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day. In many cases the avalanches are large and in some cases easily released. Shady slopes where weaknesses exist in the old snowpack are especially precarious. In some places dry avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack and reach very large size in isolated cases. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities are to be restricted to moderately steep terrain. The runout zones of large avalanches are to be avoided as well. The avalanche prone locations are widespread and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility.",
        "highlights": "Outside marked and open pistes a critical avalanche situation will prevail."
