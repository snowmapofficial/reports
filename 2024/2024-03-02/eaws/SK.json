Snow slabs and cushions of newer snow persist at high elevations in the Tatras and especially on northern exposures. Avalanche release is possible with a large additional load, on very steep, sunlit slopes spontaneous avalanches from wet snow are also possible. On grassy slopes, gliding avalanches will also occur sporadically.",
