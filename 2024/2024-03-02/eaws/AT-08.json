Evaluate the snowdrifts with caution in steep terrain. In additional, avalanches can trigger in near-surface layers of the snowpack, in isolated cases reach medium size. Danger zones occur on north-facing slopes agove 2400 m in very steep terrain, esp. in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls. Activities in backcountry demand experience in outlying terrain and the ability to assess avalanche dangers on-site, as well as a cautious route selection.  Due to increasing wetness of the snowpack, gliding snow and wet-snow activity is increasing. Glide-snow avalanches can trigger below 2600 m at any time of day or night and reach large size. Caution urged below glide cracks. Due to rain impact, mostly small-sized wet loose-snow avalanches can be expected.",

The old snowpack is generally compact and stable. At low and intermediate altitudes it is thoroughly wet down to the ground.
