On shady slopes there are still reserves of cold. Windblown slopes and crests are often hard or icy, such danger zones are especially risky for falling. Up to high altitudes the snowpack is very moist-to-wet due to rain impact, can glide over smooth ground. An area-wide snowpack begins only above the treeline."
