In places which have not yet discharged, wet glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally on steep slopes over smooth ground. Avalanche releases are usually small, sometimes medium-sized.\r\nIn steep rocky terrain on sunny slopes, small wet-snow avalanches are possible.\r\nOlder snowdrifts can be triggered by 1 person in steep ridgeline N/E facing terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, mostly small releases, the danger of falling outweighs that of being buried in snow masses.",

Also in transitions from the snowpack to the ground there is a wet layer reinforcing the gliding movement of the entire snowpack. Water seepage is increasingly dissolving the snowpack layers. At high altitudes, the snowpack is compact and stable by and large. On Saturday night above 1500 m a breakable crust can form, on the peaks of Allg\u00e4u and Werdenfels capable of bearing loads, which will soften during the daytime hours. Below 1500 m there is very little snow on the ground."
