        "comment": "The fresh snow and in particular the many sometimes large wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects and at intermediate and high altitudes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects above approximately 2000 m and in gullies and bowls. In particular in the valleys of Moli\u00e8res and Conangles, at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars and at the border to Benasque the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. The avalanche danger in these regions is within the upper range of danger level 3 (considerable). <br/> The conditions are dangerous for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities.",
        "highlights": "Fresh snow and large quantities of wind-drifted snow represent the main danger."
