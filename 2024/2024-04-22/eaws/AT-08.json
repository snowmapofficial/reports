Frequency and size of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. In case of extended bright intervals, medium-sized loose-snow avalanches are possible, possibly endangering exposed zones. Activities in outlying terrain demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. Isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible.
