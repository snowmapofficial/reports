        "comment": "Over a wide area over a wide area 10 to 15 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Sunday above approximately 1500 m. Over a wide area 40 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall on Tuesday above approximately 1500 m. The new snow and wind slabs will be deposited on a crust in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. This snow can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above the tree line. In particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation and on steep slopes medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large loose snow avalanches are to be expected as the snowfall becomes more intense. As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from southeasterly directions, easily released wind slabs will form in the course of the day. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent. Adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls such avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and larger. Backcountry touring calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
