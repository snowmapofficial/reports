Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Wind slabs can be released in isolated cases on shady slopes above approximately 2500 m. The avalanches are only small."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. <br/> Sunny slopes and intermediate altitudes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> Shady slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 50 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying. During the day: There is a danger of falling on the icy crust."
