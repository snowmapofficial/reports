        "comment": "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions, but the avalanche danger will increase later. On very steep sunny slopes small moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected above approximately 2000 m. <br/> In addition the clearly visible wind slabs of Monday are prone to triggering in very isolated cases still. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2500 m. <br/> Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",
