        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist and wet avalanches being released will increase in all aspects. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Gliding avalanches can also occur, in particular on steep grassy slopes. <br/> The wind slabs remain for the foreseeable future prone to triggering, especially adjacent to ridgelines. In all regions medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large avalanches are possible. <br/> Avalanches can be released, mostly by large loads.",
        "highlights": "The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. Backcountry tours should be started and concluded early. In many places there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. In the event of a clear night this applies in particular in the early morning."
