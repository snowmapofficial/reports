        "comment": "Avalanche danger will increase regionally during the course of the day from low to moderate. Main problem: glide-snow avalanches, possibly triggering naturally at any time of day or night in very steep terrain and plummeting down to zones where the slopes are bare of snow. In addition, wet-snow avalanches can trigger during the daytime, esp. in high-altitude terrain where there is sufficient snow on the ground. In steep terrain, small-to-medium avalanches can slide naturally or be triggered.",
