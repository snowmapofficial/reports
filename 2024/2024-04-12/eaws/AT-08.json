With ascending altitude and in high-alpine regions, fresh snowdrift accumulations and fresh snow are prone to triggering, esp. in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Easily triggerable!  Danger of wet-anow avalnches has receded as temperatures dropped, but will increase again, and more loose-snow avalanches can be expected to release from the fresh fallen snow. Glide-snow avalanches are still possible, esp. in starting zones where there is sufficient snow, releases can be large. Caution below glide cracks. Huge cornices still require caution.",
