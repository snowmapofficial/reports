As a consequence of wind from westerly directions, further wind slabs will form on Monday. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects. <br/> <br/> During the day: Natural avalanches are further to be expected. The avalanches can be released in the new snow and wind slab layers and reach large size in some cases. As a consequence of falling temperatures, the natural activity of moist and wet avalanches will gradually decrease. <br/> Avalanches can reach valley bottoms and in some places endanger exposed transportation routes.",
