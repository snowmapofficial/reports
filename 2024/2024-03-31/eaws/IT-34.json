        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong wind from southerly directions, further wind slabs will form in the course of the day adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above the tree line. The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase with altitude. As a consequence of the precipitation more frequent moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected, even large ones. On steep grassy slopes more medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible.",
