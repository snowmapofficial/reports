Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines above approximately 2200 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These places are covered with new snow and are therefore difficult to recognise. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of dry and moist avalanches being released will increase for a while in particular on very steep sunny slopes above approximately 1600 m. In isolated cases the avalanches in these regions are medium-sized and in many cases easily released. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection.",
