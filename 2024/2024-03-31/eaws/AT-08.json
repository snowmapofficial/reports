        "comment": "Beware fresh and older snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes. Due to winds at storm strength, further snowdrifts will be generated on Monday morning. Medium sized avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Danger zones occur also distant from ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls; they increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy. Avoid zones below glide cracks.",

Fresh and older snowdrift masses often lie deposited atop soft layers, esp. on shady slopes, and are trigger-prone. Below 2000 m the old snowpack is thoroughly moist, wet down to the ground, this reinforces gliding over smooth ground. Very little snow on the ground below 1500 m."
