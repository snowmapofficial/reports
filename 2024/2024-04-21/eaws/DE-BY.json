Weak layers inside the snowdrifts are still trigger-prone, esp. on high-altitude shady slopes. At intermediate altitudes and on sunny slopes, the drifts can settle and consolidate quickly. At low and intermediate altitudes the snow is moist on the surface. Due to the warm ground, the snowpack base is often wet, reinforcing the gliding movement of the entire snowpack over smooth ground."
