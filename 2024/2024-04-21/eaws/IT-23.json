        "comment": "In the last few days sometimes deep wind slabs formed in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as at high altitude. As a consequence of new snow and wind they will increase in size additionally as the day progresses. These can be released, even by a single winter sport participant, especially on very steep slopes. <br/> (--), caution is to be exercised in particular along the border with France and along the border with Switzerland. <br/> <br/> In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation loose snow avalanches are possible, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases, in particular on extremely steep slopes.",
        "highlights": "Along the border with France, along the border with Switzerland and in high Alpine regions the avalanche danger is one level higher. There is a danger of falling on the hard crust."
