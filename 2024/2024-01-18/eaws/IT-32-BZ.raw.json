      "comment" : "The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases above the tree line. This also applies in areas close to the tree line. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in all aspects. The wind slabs are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. They are to be avoided as far as possible. In some cases avalanches are medium-sized. Even a small avalanche can sweep winter sport participants along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> In addition further very occasional gliding avalanches are possible, in particular on steep east, south and west facing slopes below approximately 2600 m. In isolated cases the gliding avalanches are quite large, in particular in the regions with a lot of snow. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided."

Over a wide area over a wide area 5 to 10 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall. As a consequence of the sometimes strong wind the wind slabs will increase in size additionally. The wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is largely stable. Snow depths vary greatly above the tree line, depending on the infuence of the wind. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations."
