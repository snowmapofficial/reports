Danger zones near to and far from ridges, at entries into gullies and bowls, behind discontinuities. Instable snowdrifts are triggerable as small-to-medium slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading. Freshly generated cornices are brittle, instable, easily triggered.  \r\nIn shady, extremely steep terrain and gullies at high altitudes, isolated (also large-sized) avalanches can be triggered (persistent weak layer). Windblown, exposed surfaces are often icy and hard, acute danger of falling.",
