        "Comment": "A return to Winter on the hill today. Weather is set to stay similar over next couple of days with snow showers and lower freezing levels.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers will continue throughout the period, with moderate amounts expected. Freezing level will remain around 500 metres. Winds will be strong South-Westerly.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh accumulations of poorly bonded windslab will continue to develop in steep wind sheltered locations, mainly on North to East aspects above 800 metres. These accumulations are expected to gain depth throughout the forecast period. Scarp slopes, crag aprons, gullies and coire rims will be most affected. Fresh unstable cornices will also form above these aspects. South to Westerly aspects will generally be scoured and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "On North-West through North to East aspects, fresh windslab is forming in wind sheltered locations above 800 metres, although pockets can be found at lower elevations. Where this windslab is gaining depth there are weaknesses within it. Fresh cornices are forming over these aspects. The older spring snowpack is stable, well bonded and becoming firm. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
