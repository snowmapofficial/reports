The wind will be strong in some localities in particular along the border with France. <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. During the night the previously small wind slabs will increase in size additionally. <br/> They can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant,, especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. At elevated altitudes the likelihood of avalanches is higher. <br/> Natural avalanches: Dry loose snow avalanches and dry slab avalanches are possible from the first half of the night, in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation especially on very steep slopes.",
