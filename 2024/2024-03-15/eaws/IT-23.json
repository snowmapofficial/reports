        "comment": "A partly overcast night: The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze. This applies in particular below approximately 2200 m. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation more medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are to be expected below approximately 2600 m, especially in case of releases originating from very steep sunny starting zones. <br/> Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be started and concluded early. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from westerly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as above approximately 2700 m. They can especially at their margins be released, even by a single winter sport participant. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/>",

Towards its surface, the snowpack is largely stable and its surface has a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. This applies on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> The snowpack is dry; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow, in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> The weather conditions facilitated a gradual strengthening of the snowpack. <br/> A lot of snow is lying at intermediate and high altitudes. <br/> On very steep sunny slopes several medium-sized to large avalanches were observed. <br/> <br/> Friday: Afternoon: In particular in the northwest light snowfall above approximately 2100 m. <br/>"
