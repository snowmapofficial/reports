Already during the night we will notice a gradual warming in the mountains of Slovakia, the snow will gradually become wetter even at the highest altitudes. In the High Tatras, the Western Tatras and the western part of the Low Tatras, the second avalanche danger level - moderate - has been in force since the morning. Gradual warming will cause that the main avalanche problem will be wet snow in all orientations. The wind-wound pillows from the last days will also be dangerous, which will become heavier due to the warming. Avalanches from wet snow or foundation avalanches from wet snow may occur, especially on slopes with visible crevasses.",

      "comment" : "The warm weather in February and March has meant that snow cover is absent at lower altitudes. The change in temperatures from the mid-latitudes has caused the snow to gradually settle and become firnier, which has had a positive effect on its stability. However, warming during the night and tomorrow will cause it to become wetter and heavier. At the highest elevations of the High Tatras, especially on the N side of the mountains, there is still dry snow rolled into smaller slabs and pillows, which have a weak bond with the underlying hardened firn.  The weather of recent weeks has caused cracks to form in several places, which have triggered basement avalanches in many places. This situation may occur again during Saturday."

Already during the night we will notice a gradual warming in the mountains of Slovakia, the snow will gradually get wetter even at the highest altitudes. Due to the fact that the height of the snowpack as well as the total amount of snow in the mountains of the Fatras and the eastern part of the Low Tatras is small, there is a low avalanche danger in these mountain ranges - i.e. level 1. Gradual warming will make wet snow the main avalanche problem in all orientations. The most dangerous will be places with more snow or frequent avalanche paths.
