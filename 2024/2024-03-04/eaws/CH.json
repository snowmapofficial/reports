The near-surface snow in the south has fallen with little wind and is therefore mostly still loose. In northern areas, some of the drift snow that formed last weekend with strong southerly winds is still prone to triggering.</p><p>The old snowpack is compact in many places under the layers of new snow and snowdrift from the last week. However, it also contains various crusts and, between them, layers with a faceted crystal structure, in which avalanches have been released by people, especially in the inneralpine regions of Grisons.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes. These may be large.</p>"
