        "Summary": "GC 5/3 Isolated windslab deposits mainly on NW to E aspects + fragile cornices above 950m. Otherwise generally stable. Haz Moderate.",
        "SnowDistribution": "No snow below 450m but some light drifting at higher altitudes. Cloudy on the tops at first then much brighter so visibility was good. Variable, South-Easterly winds approx 15mph lighter at times.",
        "Comment": "Probably dry for most of the day, most precipitation is forecast towards the end of the day with snow over the higher summits. Strong winds for most of the period.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, the freezing level will rise to around 1000 metres then fall to 750m, later, rising again to near summit levels. Some light precipitation expected some briefly falling as snow, some briefly as rain. East-South-Easterly winds will reach gale to storm force in the early hours of the morning then easing, becoming South-South-Easterly.",
        "SnowStability": "New snow deposits are not expected to be significant. The  milder conditions will further help to consolidate snowpack instabilities. Isolated windslab will persist at higher elevations mainly on NW through N to E aspects above 950m. These localised deposits will be generally shallow with summit gully scarp slopes, gully exits and steep coire headwalls mainly affected. Some Westerly aspects also affected. Fragile cornices will overhang similar aspects. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions prevailed winds were fresh, South-Easterly  which felt quite wintry at higher elevations. The midday summit temperature was minus 3.1 degrees celsius.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack has mostly consolidated in many locations. However, isolated pockets of poorly bonded windslab are still present, mainly on North-West through North to East aspects above 900 metres. These deposits are quite isolated and generally shallow with summit gully scarp slopes, gully exits and steep coire head walls mainly affected.  Fragile cornices overhang similar aspects. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow above 900 metres due to drifting. Whiteout conditions initially, brighter later. Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times when facing into the wind.",
        "Comment": "A challenging day is in prospect, with gale force winds and significant drifting.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow is expected overnight before resuming late in the period, this will be confined to terrain above 1000 metres. Winds will be gale force from the South-East, decreasing to strong South-South-Easterlies by the end of the period. The freezing level will fluctuate between 900 and 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Poorly bonded windslab will accumulate throughout the period, as existing snow is redistributed. The greatest instability will be on West to North aspects above 900 metres, particularly in steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims, gullies and crag aprons. North-East aspects will also be subject to cross-loading. Areas exposed to the wind will become increasingly scoured. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A generally dry day. Winds were from the South-East, initially moderate, becoming strong later. The freezing level was around 800 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh poorly bonded windslab was deposited overnight and as the day progressed, on West to North aspects above 900 metres. Older deposits containing weaknesses also persist on the same aspects. Areas most affected are steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims, gullies and crag aprons. Outwith these areas, the cover consists of unconsolidated snow lying on bare ground or firm snow patches. Slopes exposed to the wind are scoured and icy. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "Comment": "The South-Easterly airstream continues, bringing dry and clear conditions to the North-West of Scotland. Freezing level rising to summit level during the day, indicating a slow depletion in the snow pack.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Gale force East-South-East winds possibly gusting overnight to Storm force; easing to strong during the day.  A light shower falling as snow at summit levels late afternoon in the West of the region. The freezing level will fluctuate around summit level or just below.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected. The remaining old, firm snow will be confined to steep North through East to South-East aspects above 800 meters. The snowpack will continue to consolidate and is expected to be generally stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Deposits will only be moderately bonded particularly on steeper terrain such as gully tops and corrie rims. Any cornices will remain unstable. Elsewhere the snow cover will thaw and diminish. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

On other aspects the snowpack tends to be shallow and patchy with isolated areas of windslab. The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",
