        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low in general. Main problem: naturally triggered glide-snow and wet-snow avalanches on very steep, esp. south-facing slopes above 1900 m. Potential starting zones and glide crack zones should be avoided. In addition, on steep north-facing slopes at high altitude large additional loading can trigger a slab avalanche.",

Light to moderate NW winds, brisk gusts in the NE mountains. At 1500 m in the north: +1 degree; at 2000 m: -3 degrees; in the south at 1500 m: +4 degrees; at 2000 m: 0 degrees."
