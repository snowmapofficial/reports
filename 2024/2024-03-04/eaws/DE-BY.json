In the uppermost part of the snowpack soft layers are embedded between melt-freeze crusts at high altitudes. These are, however, difficult to trigger. The old snowpack is compact and stable by and large. Up to high altitudes it is thoroughly moist and down to the ground frequently wet. In places, gliding movements are possible. In all aspects below 1500 m an area-wide cohesive snowpack is rare."
