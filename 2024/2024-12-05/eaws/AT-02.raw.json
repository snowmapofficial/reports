Only in the valleys will persistent fog often prevail, or flat high-fog with the uppermost border between 700 and 900 m. Generally, light N/NE winds. At midday at 2000m: -8 degrees; at 3000m: -13 degrees."

      "comment" : "In gullies and bowls above approximately 2600m, isolated avalanches can be triggered particularly by large additional loading. The releases will mostly be small-sized and occur especially in shady, wind-protected zones along the Salzburg border. Apart from the risk of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and taking a fall should be taken into consideration."

The upper part of the snowpack is soft; the mid-level layers are faceted; the lower layers are hardened. There is little snow on the ground."
