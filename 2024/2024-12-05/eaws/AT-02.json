        "comment": "In gullies and bowls above approximately 2600m, isolated avalanches can be triggered particularly by large additional loading. The releases will mostly be small-sized and occur especially in shady, wind-protected zones along the Salzburg border. Apart from the risk of being buried in snow masses, the danger of being swept along and taking a fall should be taken into consideration.",
