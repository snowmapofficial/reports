      "comment" : "In the High and Western Tatras, a moderate avalanche danger (2nd degree) has been declared for the afternoon. Up to 25 cm of new snow fell above 1,500 m above sea level on Tuesday, but it is gradually melting. The new snow fell on top of the old hard snow. These two layers have become well bonded over the last few days. But the problem is warming, which brings the risk of wet avalanches, a risk that increases in the afternoon due to clear, sunny weather. The snow cover will become soaked and lose cohesion. Spontaneous small avalanches or avalanches can also occur. Caution in very steep slopes where even a small avalanche can cause a shear and fall, resulting in mechanical injuries. Glide avalanches can also occur due to the soaking of the entire snow profile.",
