Owing to solar radiation and the significant rise in temperatures, this moistening process in the snowpack is advancing rapidly at high altitudes, where weak layers are becoming wet for the first time and are consequently unstable. Wet avalanches, including large ones, are still to be expected. Gliding avalanches are expected on steep grassy slopes and rocky ledges. These may occasionally become very large in the snowy south.</p><p>With the mild temperatures and only partially clear nights, the snowpack only freezes to the point at which it is capable of bearing loads above approximately 2400 m and quickly softens again due to solar radiation. Dry snow can now only be found on steep north-facing slopes above approximately 2400 to 2800 m.</p><p>In deeper layers of the snowpack, people can still release dry avalanches in some places, especially in southern Valais, central Grisons and Engadine.</p>"
