        "comment": "Weakly bonded old snow at high altitude. Below approximately 1500 m hardly any snow is lying. Above approximately 1500 m a little snow is lying. The weather conditions from the late morning will give rise to increasing and thorough wetting of the old snowpack. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in places that are protected from the wind. Here small wind slabs formed. These avalanche prone locations are rather rare. These are shallow and can be released in isolated cases."
