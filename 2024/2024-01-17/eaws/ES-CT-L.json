        "comment": "The moist fresh snow and in particular the wind slabs formed by the moderate to strong southwesterly wind must be evaluated with care and prudence. The fresh wind slabs are mostly small but in some cases prone to triggering. In particular in the valleys bordering the Esera basin and the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and at high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Gliding avalanches are also to be expected at any time. In isolated cases they are medium-sized. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
