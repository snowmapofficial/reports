The fresh wind slabs are mostly small but in some cases prone to triggering. In particular in the valleys bordering the Esera basin and the Ribagor√ßana basin and at high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Gliding avalanches are also to be expected at any time. In isolated cases they are medium-sized. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible."
