The foehn-induced drifts from last weekend are unlikely to trigger. Most danger zones are on N/E facing slopes, in high-alpine regions also on south-facing slopes. Above 2300 m isolated weak layers on shady slopes triggerably by large additional loading, large avalanches possible.\r\nIn steep terrain, small wet loose-snow avalanches and isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
