Medium-sized natural avalanches are possible, especially in case of releases originating from very steep starting zones that have retained the snow thus far. <br/> Backcountry tours and off-piste skiing should be started and concluded early. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of a moderate to strong wind from northerly directions, clearly visible wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as above approximately 2400 m.

These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain.",
