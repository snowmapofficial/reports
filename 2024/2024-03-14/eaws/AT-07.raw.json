The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls.

Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> During the day: As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches, in particular on very steep sunny slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. From origins in starting zones where no previous releases have taken place more gliding avalanches are possible, in particular medium-sized ones.
