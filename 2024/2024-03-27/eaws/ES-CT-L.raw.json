      "comment" : "The sometimes deep wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on steep shady slopes above the tree line. Sometimes the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The prevalence of such avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase appreciably on very steep sunny slopes. The avalanches in these regions are rather small. <br/> Defensive route selection is important."

      "comment" : "20 to 25 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, has fallen since Tuesday. 5 to 10 cm of snow will fall until the evening above approximately 1800 m. The southerly wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> <br/> The solar radiation will give rise from early morning to increasing moistening of the snowpack on sunny slopes. The new snow and wind slabs have bonded well with the old snowpack in all aspects."
