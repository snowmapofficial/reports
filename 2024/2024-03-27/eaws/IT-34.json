        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. The prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. Caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Small and medium-sized avalanches are possible. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",

In places that are protected from the wind wind slabs formed. These are poorly bonded with the old snowpack in all aspects above the tree line. <br/> 5 to 20 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall on Thursday above approximately 1000 m. <br/> The wind slabs will be covered with new snow in some cases and therefore difficult to recognise."
