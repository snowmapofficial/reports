At altitudes above 2000m above sea level, slabs and pillows of wind-blown snow still occur in the eastern and northern troughs and moguls. The avalanche danger is particularly high on very steep slopes with high additional mechanical loads.\nAt lower altitudes, wet avalanches from melting snow will be a particular risk. Small spontaneous avalanches are also likely to occur in the event of rain.",
