Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls; they increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Due to warmth and radiation, slides and loose-snow avalanches are possible, esp. on sunny slopes. Below 2600 m, glide-snow avalnches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy.",
