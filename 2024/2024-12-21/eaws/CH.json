The new snow and snowdrifts are lying on the more wind-sheltered western, northern and eastern slopes above 1800 to 2000 metres on a metamorphosed surface of the snowpack and are therefore highly prone to triggering. In all regions, there are also faceted weak layers deeper in the snowpack. Avalanches can be triggered in these weak layers and become large. This weak snow layering is unfavourable for the heavy snowfall expected from Sunday.</p><p>There is still little snow on the southern flank of the Alps, in the Engadine and in central Grisons, so ski tours are still hardly possible.</p>"
