        "comment": "The fresh snow as well as the mostly small wind slabs will be deposited on a weakly bonded old snowpack above approximately 1700 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on steep shady slopes and adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. New snow and wind slabs are lying on the smooth surface of an old snowpack. The fresh snow and the wind slabs are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack. In particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent.",
