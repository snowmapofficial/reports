Winds remained gale force in strength from the West-South-West.  Freezing level rose to 600 metres during the day.\nObservedSnowStability: Significant drifting has resulting in the continuing development of unstable windslab which has become more widespread.

Overnight snowfall to low levels gave way to a showery day. The freezing level rose to around 600 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: Continual drifting of snow in the strong winds has formed further deposits of unstable windslab in wind sheltered areas. Greatest accumulations are on North through East to South-East aspects above 800 metres. Fragile and building cornices are present above these aspects. Windslab is also present on other aspects due to cross loading. Slopes exposed to the strong winds are being scoured. The avalanche hazard is Considerable."
