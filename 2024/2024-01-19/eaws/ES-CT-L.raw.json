The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in extremely steep terrain and in steep rocky terrain. In the valleys bordering the Esera basin and the Ribagor√ßana basin and at high altitude the avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."
