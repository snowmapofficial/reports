The strong wind will transport the new snow significantly. <br/> In the neighbouring regions and at intermediate and high altitudes the danger of dry avalanches will increase gradually to level 3 (considerable) in the afternoon. <br/> The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in all aspects above the tree line. They will be deposited on soft layers in particular on north to east to south facing aspects. <br/> The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Meticulous route selection is appropriate. <br/> In the morning and where less new snow falls, the danger of falling on hard snow remains, so it is advisable to carry snow knives and crampons for the steeper sections.",
