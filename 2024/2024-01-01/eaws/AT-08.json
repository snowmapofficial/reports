Frequency and size of these zones increase with ascending altitude. Small-to-medium sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. The risks of falling need consideration, esp. on hard, icy steep slopes, despite being blanketed by fresh snow. A cautious route selection is advised. Danger of glide-snow avalanches, although their activity has receded: on steep smooth slopes in all aspects below 2200 m, small-to-medium releases are possible, difficult to assess, possible at any time of day.
