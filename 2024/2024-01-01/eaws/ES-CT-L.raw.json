      "comment" : "The avalanche conditions in the morning, after a clear night, are favourable. Individual gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on extremely steep sunny slopes. Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

      "comment" : "The snowpack is largely stable and its surface has a melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> In particular shady slopes: In many places there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. <br/> At high altitude there are 30 to 50 cm of snow. In all regions snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
