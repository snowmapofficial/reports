The new and drifted snow is covering a faceted weakly bonded old snowpack, especially on west-, north- and east-facing slopes. However, the thick layer covering the weakly bonded old snow should have a positive effect in the coming days and reduce probable triggering in the old snow. The situation is more critical in southern Valais and from northern Ticino through northern Grisons to Lower Engadine, where the weakly bonded old snow is covered by around 50 to 80 cm of snow. South of this region, in central and southern Grisons and in central Ticino, there is still little snow, and the thin old snowpack is mainly fully faceted and loose. It is lightly covered with fresh snowdrift accumulations, but these are prone to triggering.</p>"},"lang":"en"}],"customData":{"CH":{"base":"6930bf19-77cb-4aa4-b589-a51add2335c3:14"}}}
