        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. <br/> <br/> The wet fresh snow and the sometimes deep wind slabs can still be released in some cases in all aspects and generally at high altitude. They are lying on weak layers. In addition small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized gliding avalanches are to be expected. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and restraint.",

        "comment": "30 to 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, fell on Monday. The sometimes storm force wind has transported the new snow significantly. Up to high altitudes rain fell in the past few hours. A great many medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large moist slab avalanches have been released as the penetration by moisture increases. Released avalanches and field observations confirm poor snowpack stability. The surface of the snowpack is hardly frozen at all and will soften quickly. As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase gradually in particular on steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> At intermediate altitudes there are 50 to 100 cm of snow. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
