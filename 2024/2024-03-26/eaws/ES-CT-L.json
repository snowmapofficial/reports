        "comment": "The new snow can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant in all aspects above approximately 1800 m. The avalanches are rather small but in many cases easily released. <br/> The mostly small wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in particular on steep shady slopes and generally at high altitude. <br/> The prevalence of avalanche prone locations and likelihood of triggering will increase as the day progresses. These places are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. Towards the evening possibly danger level 3 (considerable) will be reached in the south and in the southwest.",
