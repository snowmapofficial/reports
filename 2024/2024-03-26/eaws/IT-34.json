        "comment": "Wind and new snow. Over a wide area 40 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall above approximately 1900 m. As a consequence of the precipitation the prevalence of the avalanche prone locations will increase from the late morning. As the snowfall level rises medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large moist and wet avalanches are possible. In gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain as well as at high altitude deep wind slabs will form. The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant.",
