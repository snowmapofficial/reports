        "comment": "There is a moderate avalanche danger at altitudes above 1800 m above sea level. The main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Dangerous are leeward sides of ridges, places under rock walls and narrow couloirs. Especially in these places there are locally inflated slabs and pillows, which are deposited on very hard ground. Their loosening is possible with high additional loads on very steep slopes. Avalanches from wet snow will also be threatened in the afternoon due to the significant warming. The combination of slabs of packed snow that melt is very treacherous. Avalanche danger needs to be assessed locally in all orientations.\nSmall and medium sized slab avalanches are a threat and can be released on very steep slopes, especially by large additional loads. Small spontaneous avalanches can be expected on extremely steep slopes.",

Softening of the new snow cover can be expected on slopes of all orientations.\n\nAt lower and middle altitudes, the snow cover is already patchy."
