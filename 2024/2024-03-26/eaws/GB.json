During the day the light precipitation will continue, falling as snow only at increasingly higher altitudes, reaching 900 metres by late afternoon. Near gale force North-Easterly winds overnight, easing to strong East-North-Easterlies by morning, then moderate South-Easterly by the end of the period.\nObserved Weather Influences: Light overnight snowfall to glen level. A dry morning with light hail or snow showers to glen level during the afternoon. Fresh North-Easterly, veering Easterly winds. Freezing level rising to around 700 metres.\nObservedSnowStability: A light, general covering of soft snow with localised accumulations of soft windslab in wind sheltered locations on mainly South-West to North-West aspects above 900 metres. Distribution is limited but accumulations are unstable and locally significant. Multiple small sets of avalanche debris were noted on a Westerly aspect at 975 metres.  Elsewhere the old snow is firm and often icy. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
