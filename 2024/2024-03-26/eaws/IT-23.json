The wind will be strong at times in some localities. The wind slabs are bonding poorly with the old snowpack at intermediate and high altitudes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes, and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. They can be released easily in some places. <br/> Medium-sized to large avalanches are possible. In the typical avalanche paths in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation dry avalanches can in isolated cases reach as far as the valley bottom. In the late morning in some localities danger level 4 (high) will be reached in these regions.",
