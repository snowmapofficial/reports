        "comment": "As a consequence of the precipitation dry avalanches are to be expected as the day progresses, but they will be mostly small. These can be released by small loads or triggered naturally. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent small moist avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones.",

At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
