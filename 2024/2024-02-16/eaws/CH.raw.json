It will be quite sunny on and to the south of the Main Alpine Ridge. Around 10 to 20 cm of new fallen snow is possible in the north, although the amount of precipitation is still uncertain. There will be a moderate to strong northwesterly wind. The danger of dry avalanches will increase somewhat. Moist snow slides are unlikely in the north, but will still be possible in the south due to warmer daytime temperatures. The danger of gliding avalanches will not change significantly.</p>"}],"validTime":{"endTime":"2024-02-17T16:00:00Z","startTime":"2024-02-16T16:00:00Z"},"bulletinID":"c37b91ae-17c9-40cf-9249-ba6155b1855f","customData":{"CH":{"aggregation":[{"category":"wet","problemTypes":["wet_snow","gliding_snow"],"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}]}},"nextUpdate":"2024-02-17T16:00:00Z","unscheduled":false,"dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","customData":{"CH":{"subdivision":null}},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"weatherReview":{"comment":"<h1>Weather review for Friday, 16.02.2024</h1><p>The night was fairly clear apart from some thin clouds.
