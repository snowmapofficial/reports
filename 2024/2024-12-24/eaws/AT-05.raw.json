Medium sized slab avalanches from snowdrifts can be triggered even by minimum additional loading above the greeline, particularly in gullies and bowls and behind protruberances in the landscape in all aspects. Above 2200m avalanches can be triggered from more deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack and often grow to large size. Settling noises and glide-craceks are indicators of danger. Isolated naturally triggered avalanches are possible at high altitudes."
