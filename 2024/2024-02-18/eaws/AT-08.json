        "comment": "As a result of fresh snowfall and strong NW winds, trigger-prone snowdrift accumulations will be generated. Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. Medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Snow sports in outlying terrain demand experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site. The snowdrift accumulations will increase further as the day progresses. Loose-snow avalanches can trigger natureally in steep rocky terrain. Glide-snow avalanaches can trigger at any time of day or night below 2600 m and grow to medium size. Caution below glide cracks.",

The fresh snow and drifts will be deposited atop soft layers on high altitude shady slopes, elsewhere mostly atop a hard old snowpack. There are trigger-prone layers inside the fresh drifts. In addition, on high-altitude shadyn slopes there are near-surfae weak layers which are prone to triggering in isolated cases. The warm ground and wet snowpack base reinforce gliding snowpack movements, esp on E/S/W facing slopes. Below 1400 m there is very little snow on the ground."
