The avalanches can be released by small loads or triggered naturally. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> On steep shady slopes and in the vicinity of peaks natural dry avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. The avalanches can in isolated cases be released by people. <br/>"

      "comment" : "Some snow will fall until late morning in some regions. <br/> Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze and will already soften in the late morning. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
