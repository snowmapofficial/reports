        "Comment": "Possibility of cooler weather later this week.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mainly dry with some very light rain overnight and a trace of snow above 1000 metres during the morning. Near gale, generally Westerly winds. Freezing level lowering overnight to settle at around 1000 metres during daylight hours.",
        "SnowStability": "The wet snow patches will start to firm up on the highest summits but will continue to slowly thaw below 1000 metres. All remaining snow will be well bonded and stable. Deepest snow will be encountered in wind sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 900 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Largest areas are present in wind sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Ice and rock fall continue to present a hazard during prolonged thaw conditions.

Slight accumulations of fresh windslab will form on sheltered Easterly aspects above this altitude, but these are not expected to be significant.
