The avalanches can be released by small loads or triggered naturally. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> On steep shady slopes and in the vicinity of peaks natural dry avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. The avalanches can in isolated cases be released by people. <br/>",

Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
