        "Comment": "New snow amounts not expected to be great, areas of windslab both existing and fresh should generally be avoidable. Cornices will be prone to collapse.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry conditions are expected overnight with light new snow above 600 metres later on Tuesday. Winds will be fresh  occasionally strong generally Easterly. The freezing level through the day will be around 600 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "The old snowpack where exposed will be stable and may be icy in places. Weaknesses will remain in areas of  existing windslab on steep North-East to South-East aspects. New snow and wind transport of existing deposits will form weakly bonded windslab in wind sheltered areas such as gullies and Westerly to Northerly aspects, these areas are not expected to be deep or extensive and should be generally avoidable. Cornices will be prone to collapse.   The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Existing windslab in gullies and North-East to South-Easterly aspects is generally stable on all but the steepest slopes where instabilities remain.  Cornices are prone to collapse.

        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry night will proceed precipitation falling as snow above 550 metres from mid morning. Winds will be moderate North-Easterly overnight veering to the East-South-East and increasing to strong by the end of the forecast period. The freezing level will fluctuate between 600 and 700 metres.",

As the day progresses further localised deposits of unstable windlab will build on North-West to North aspects above 950 metres. The greatest instability will be where these deposits are deeper in steep wind sheltered areas such as convexities, coire rims and gully tops. Outwith these locations the older snowpack will be firm and stable, with new snow above 550 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Snow fell above 600 metres overnight, with squally snow showers persisting through the day above 700 metres. Winds were moderate to strong and of a North-North-Westerly direction at midday. The freezing level was around 900 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Moderately bonded windslab was present on North-East to South-East aspects above 950 metres. Accumulations show instability where they are deeper, such as in steep wind sheltered locations close to coire rims, in gully tops or where they form convexities. There is a thin covering of new snow above 700 metres. Elsewhere, the older snowpack is firm and stable, and quickly softened due to solar radiation. There is a thin covering of new snow above 700 metres. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "It is possible that the Torridon forecast area will avoid the worst of the changeable weather expected over the next few days, allowing the existing snowpack to continue to slowly consolidate.",
