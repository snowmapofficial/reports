        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. On Tuesday night and during the day on Wednesday: snowfall and wind will increase danger somewhat. With ascending altitude and in high-alpine regions, fresh snowdrift accumulations and fresh snow will be prone to triggering, esp. in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Easily triggerable!  Danger of wet-anow avalnches will recede as temperatures drop. Glide-snow avalanches are still possible, esp. in starting zones where there is sufficient snow, releases can be large. Caution below glide cracks. Huge cornices still require caution.",
