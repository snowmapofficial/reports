There will be some rain at all levels during the day. Gale force Westerly winds will back Southerly.\nObserved Weather Influences: Significant quantities of snow fell above about 800 metres during the latter part of the night and through the morning. The freezing level varied between about 1000 metres and 1200 metres during the day. North-Westerly winds strengthened through the day.\nObservedSnowStability: Areas of windslab have been deposited in wind sheltered locations on mainly East to South aspects above 1000 metres. These deposits are unstable particularly where they overlie the old firm snowpack. Fresh cornices above these aspects are prone to collapse. Windward aspects tend to be scoured and stable. Below 1000 metres the snowpack is damp and stability better. The avalanche hazard is Considerable."
