As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes storm force southerly foehn wind, mostly small wind slabs will form at elevated altitudes. These are to be evaluated with care and prudence in extreme terrain. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> In very isolated cases dry avalanches can also be released in near-surface layers of the snowpack and reach quite a large size. This applies in particular in the inneralpine regions of both Valais and Grisons. Extremely slopes are to be traversed by snow sport participants one at a time.",

In the east, the snowpack is likely to freeze during the partly clear night, to the point at which it is capable of bearing loads, above approximately 2400 m. In the other regions, it will cool only poorly. Dry snow can now only be found on steep north-facing slopes above approximately 2600 m. Very few human-triggered avalanches have been reported in recent days.
