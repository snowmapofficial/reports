There are hardly any weak layers in the lower part of the snowpack that are prone to triggering. To date, gliding avalanches have mainly occurred on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below around 2500 m and, less frequently, on north-facing slopes below around 2200 m. Although gliding avalanche activity has decreased somewhat, such avalanches could still be released at any time of day or night and may be large in regions with a lot of snow.</p><p>Snow depths are above average at high altitudes, except in the south. They are below average to average at intermediate altitudes and generally in the south. On north-facing slopes, the snow lines in the north are between 1000 and 1400 m, while in the south and also in some parts of southern Valais they are between 1400 and 1800 m. On south-facing slopes, the snow lines are 200 to 400 m higher.</p>"
