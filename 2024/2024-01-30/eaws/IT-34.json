        "comment": "Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2400 m, also in gullies and bowls in particular above approximately 1500 m, as well as on steep sunny slopes. <br/> More recent wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads,. The hard wind slabs are easy to recognise. Skiers can release avalanches only in isolated cases, including medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found also in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain.",
        "highlights": "The backcountry touring conditions in the morning, after a clear night, are mostly favourable."
