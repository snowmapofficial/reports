        "comment": "At night only a thin melt-freeze crust can form, it quickly melts in the morning. Apart from altitude, aspect and steepness gradient decide the degree of wetness. On steep E/S facing slopes they are the first to become wet, on south-facing slopes up to high alpine regions, on E/W facing slopes up to 3000 m, on north-facing slopes below 2600 m. The snowpack is stable, so most avalanches are wet-snow ones, esp. in zones where there is not as much snow on the ground, they trigger esp. with large additional loading or when a cornice breaks. The loss of firmness leads to massive amounts of snow being possibly swept along in the plummet paths of releasing avalanches, even down to zones below 1700 m where there is hardly any snow."
