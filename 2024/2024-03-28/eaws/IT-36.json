        "comment": "The fresh snow as well as the wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence at intermediate and high altitudes. This applies in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. In all aspects large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and wind. <br/> Gradual increase in danger of moist avalanches as a consequence of warming. The rain will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack over a wide area in particular at low and intermediate altitudes. Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. Avalanches can be released, even by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. The weather report and anticipated change in the avalanche danger are uncertain.",
        "highlights": "As a consequence of warming during the day the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase as the day progresses. The new snow and wind slabs represent the main danger."
