Large wind slabs have formed there, even at a distance from ridgelines. These are slowly stabilising. In the north, the storm-force southerly winds and the foehn winds have caused the loose snow to drift. Some ridges and surfaces adjacent to ridgelines have been blown completely clear. The wind slabs are mostly medium-sized to large and prone to triggering. In some regions, they were covered with new snow on Wednesday afternoon, making them difficult to spot.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places and for the most part do not contain distinct weak layers. In the past week, the old snowpack was soaked up to approximately 3000 m on south-facing slopes, up to 2000-2500 m on east- and west-facing slopes, and up to approximately 1800-2000 m on north-facing slopes.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and on north-facing slopes below approximately 2000 m.
