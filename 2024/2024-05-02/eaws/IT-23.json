        "comment": "As a consequence of solar radiation numerous moist loose snow avalanches are possible, in particular medium-sized ones, especially on very steep slopes, and at the base of rock walls. As the moisture increases more wet avalanches are possible. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a sometimes moderate northwesterly wind, deep wind slabs will form especially at elevated altitudes, in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Several medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large slab avalanches are possible especially on very steep slopes. <br/> <br/> Meticulous route selection is recommended. The fresh snow and the wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above approximately 2200 m. In particular at elevated altitudes the prevalence and size of the avalanche prone locations will increase.",
