On south-facing slopes, the surface of the snowpack became moist up to around 2500 m, where a crust froze during the night. Otherwise, the surface of the snowpack is characterised by the wind in many places and is usually hard or brittle. There are still isolated weak layers in the old snowpack near the surface above approximately 2500 m, but hardly any avalanches have been reported over the past few days. The bottom section of the snowpack is generally stable.</p><p>Individual gliding avalanches are still possible. This is mainly the case on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below around 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in regions with a lot of snow.</p>"
