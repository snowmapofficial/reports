        "comment": "Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist and wet avalanches are possible. <br/> The fresh wind slabs are to be found in the vicinity of peaks. The wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads,. The hard wind slabs are easy to recognise.",
        "highlights": "The snowpack will be quite stable. The more recent wind slabs are clearly recognisable."

        "comment": "The weather was mild. The spring-like weather conditions gave rise to moistening of the snowpack. As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface during the last few days. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. The sometimes strong wind will transport only a little snow. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution and restraint."
