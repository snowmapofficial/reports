Light to moderate  North-Westerly winds, became more variable later. The freezing level remained at lower levels.\nObservedSnowStability: There has been fresh snowfall on all aspects and at all levels. Fresh accumulations of soft, unstable windslab have formed in wind sheltered locations on mainly North-East through East to South aspects above 850 metres. Main accumulations are around crags, buttresses, coire rims, and gullies. Other locations and aspects are affected by the variable winds. Cornices are also present on these aspects.
