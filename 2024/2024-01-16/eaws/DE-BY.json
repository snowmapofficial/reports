Naturally triggered wet loose-snow and slab avalanches can be expected on steep slopes at intermediate altitudes, often reaching medium size but with large runout zones. Exposed transportation routes can be placed at risk.\r\nIn additional, snowdrifts are a problem at high altitudes. Danger zones are numerous, occur in steep ridgeline terrain on NW/N/SE facing slopes, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as slab avalanches by one sole person and reach medium size.",
