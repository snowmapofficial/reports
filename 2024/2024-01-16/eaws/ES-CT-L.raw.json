On shady slopes numerous medium-sized to large moist slab avalanches are to be expected below approximately 2400 m. On grassy slopes numerous medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large gliding avalanches are to be expected in all altitude zones. Already in the early morning, individual, then as a consequence of the rain more, and in some cases even medium-sized, moist snow slides are to be expected. <br/> <br/> The conditions are unfavourable for ski touring, freeriding and snowshoe hiking in steep terrain. The runout zones of large avalanches are to be treated with caution as well."
