This unfavourable old snow surface has been covered with a little new snow or with snowdrift in the last few days. New snow, rain and wind are creating further snowdrift accumulations. These are prone to triggering due to the poor connection to the old snowpack. There are hardly any critical weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>Below approximately 2200 m, the rain will moisten the loose layer under the snowdrift and small to medium-sized wet snow avalanches are possible. Some medium-sized and, rarely, large gliding avalanches are still possible, especially at altitudes between 2000 and 2600 m.</p>"

This unfavourable old snow surface has been covered with a little new snow or with snowdrift in the last few days. New snow, rain and wind are creating further snowdrift accumulations. These are prone to triggering due to the poor connection to the old snowpack. There are hardly any critical weak layers deeper in the snowpack.</p><p>Below approximately 2200 m, the rain will moisten the loose layer under the snowdrift and small to medium-sized wet snow avalanches are possible. Some medium-sized and, rarely, large gliding avalanches are still possible, especially at altitudes between 2000 and 2600 m.</p>"
