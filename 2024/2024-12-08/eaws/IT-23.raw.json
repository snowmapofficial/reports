Fresh wind slabs will form especially adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. The new snow and wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant. Caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, in the regions exposed to a lot of wind especially on very steep slopes, in particular. <br/> In particular along the border with France these avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. Here the avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> As a consequence of the snowfall individual small to medium-sized natural dry avalanches are possible above approximately 2200 m. <br/>"
