        "comment": "In the highest, northern positions of the High Tatras there is still dry wind-blown snow, which can be rarely deposited in the form of pillows and smaller slabs. The snow is generally well stabilised. The snow cover is hard in the early morning and mid-morning. As the day warms up, the snow loses its cohesion and smaller spontaneous avalanches and drifts of wet snow may occur in the afternoon.  In the evening, significant cooling will cause hardening of melted snow.",
