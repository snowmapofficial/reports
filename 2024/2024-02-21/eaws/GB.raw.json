        "Comment": "Colder temperatures with some snowfall to around 600 metres. Remaining cold with further snowfall expected.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow falling to around 600 metres overnight will ease by early morning, with some Isolated and light snow showers expected during the day. The freezing will be around 600 metres lowering to 400 metres during the afternoon. Winds will be strong South-Westerlies.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of fresh windslab will develop in wind sheltered locations on North-West through North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. The greatest areas of instability will be where the new windslab gains depth and overlies the older firm snow patches, mostly confined to coire rims and gully tops. Elsewhere the new snow will overlie bare ground. Fragile cornices will start to reform. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The old snowpack is generally stable, and softened during the day due to fluctuating temperatures. A cosmetic dusting of new snow was observed to lie above 700 metres. The greatest seasonal snow cover mostly lies on North to East aspects above 900 metres, such as high coires and scarp slopes. At lower elevations the patchy cover is characterised by ribbons of snow in depressions and burn lines. The avalanche hazard is Low.",
