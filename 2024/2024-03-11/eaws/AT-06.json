        "comment": "Above 1400 m avalanche danger is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main problem: fresh, trigger-prone snowdrifts. Slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person in the fresh fallen snow, releases medium-sized. In addition, in extended north-facing terrain, older snowdrift masses from the weekend can still trigger slab avalanches by large additional loading. Beware esp. the entries into steep gullies and bowls, also behind discontinuities, the strong winds can form trigger-prone snowdrift accumulations also in wooded zones. Frequency and size of snowdrifts increase with ascending altitude, hard to recognize  due to poor visibility.\r\nIn extremely steep terrain, repeated dry loose-snow avalanches are possible during the precipitation, releases small-to-medium.",
