        "comment": "The sometimes strong wind will transport the new snow. Sometimes deep wind slabs will form. These will be deposited on a weakly bonded old snowpack in particular on very steep north, northeast and northwest facing slopes. <br/> On steep slopes and at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain natural dry avalanches are possible, even large ones in isolated cases. From starting zones at higher altitudes natural avalanches, capable of reaching the valleys, must be expected in isolated cases. <br/> The soft wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/>",
