        "comment": "Wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches are the main danger, the latter highly difficult to forecast or estimate. They can trigger in all aspecdts below 2600 m at any time of day or night and grow to medium size. Avoid zones below glide cracks. In zones with rain impactd, wet-snow avalanches are possible; fresh snowdrift accumulaetions require attentiveness in high-altitude ridgeline terrain, gullies, bowls, they are often trigger-prone (along with covered snowdrifts). Danger zones increase with ascending altitude. One winter sports enthusiast can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche. Apart from the dangers of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall also need consideration. Beware cornices on ridges.",

      "snowpackStructure": {
        "comment": "Due to nighttime rainfall the old snowpack is being weakened up to high altitudes. Warm ground and wet snowbase reinforce gliding movements of the whole snowpack. Below 1400 m there is very little snow on the ground. As a result of 10-15 cm of fresh snow plus wind impact, further, mostly small-sized snowdrift accumulations will be generated. Fresh snow and small snowdrifts lie deposited atop a stable old snowpack surface. Fresh drifts at high-alpine altitudes have weak layers in the uppermost part of the snowpack, often trigger-prone."
