      "comment" : "Avalanche danger is concentrated in the highest altitudes of the Tatras, where less stable snow slabs and pillows are formed by wind. Dangerous places are located on leeward slopes, troughs and moguls, mostly with southern, eastern or northern orientation. Moderate avalanches may be released after a large additional load. Caution is required in places where old packed snow alternates with wind-blown snow deposits in the form of slabs and pillows. During the day, the zero isotherm will rise above 1500 m a.s.l. Rain will cause waterlogging and a reduction in snow stability, especially at middle altitudes (up to 1600 m a.s.l.). Spontaneous minor avalanches and avalanches from wet snow are expected, possibly even medium-sized wet avalanches. At middle altitudes, rain-saturated snow may trigger glide avalanches, especially on grassy slopes."

The snow is very unevenly distributed, some places are blown down to the hard, icy old snow base. On others, on the contrary, a larger amount of snow is blown by the wind. At lower and middle altitudes, the snow will soften, mush and lose its cohesion due to rain. In the afternoon, the snow will be soaked throughout the profile."

The inflow of warm air will cause soaking and a decrease in snow stability, especially in the middle altitudes (up to 1700 m a.s.l.).  Snow will be wetted throughout the profile due to warming. The avalanche danger is concentrated in the highest altitudes of the Fatra Mountains, where there is still enough snow for the formation of wet avalanches. Smaller spontaneous avalanches and avalanches from wet snow are expected, as well as medium-sized wet avalanches. Spontaneous foundation avalanches are possible on grassy slopes."
