        "comment": "The wind will be moderate to strong. The large quantity of fresh snow as well as the wind slabs that are being formed by the northwesterly wind will become increasingly prone to triggering. This applies in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. The new snow and wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above approximately 1800 m. <br/> In particular at intermediate and high altitudes medium-sized and large natural avalanches are possible. In the regions exposed to a lot of new snow this applies especially.",
