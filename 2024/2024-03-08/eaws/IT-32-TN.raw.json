Caution is to be exercised in particular on steep shady slopes, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls in particular at elevated altitudes. <br/> Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released by individual winter sport participants. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Places where surface hoar has been covered with snow are especially unfavourable. Avalanches can reach large size in isolated cases. Careful route selection is recommended. <br/> In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists, in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. These can in isolated cases reach quite a large size. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible."
