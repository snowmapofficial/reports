Several more avalanches occurred over the weekend, at least one of which was human-triggered.",

Instability was found in wind slabs last weekend, and this weakness may still persist at higher elevations. Weak layers developed due to high-temperature gradient observed in snow pits over the weekend in Siglufjordur, indicating significant instability and propagation with very little stress on the interface of firn and wind slab. Now, with warming this week in the mountains, there has been considerable instability and several minor slab avalanches. Snow has strengthened throughout the week and will likely further strengthen with overnight frost during the weekend. Expect weaknesses to persist in higher elevations and inland on Tr\u00f6llaskagi."
