        "comment": "Avalanche danger is concentrated in the highest altitudes of the Tatras, where less stable snow slabs and pillows are formed by wind. Dangerous places are located on leeward slopes, troughs and moguls, mostly with south to east orientation. Medium-sized avalanches can be released in such places, mainly after a large additional load. Caution is required in places where old packed snow alternates with wind-blown snow deposits in the form of slabs and pillows.  The zero isotherm will rise to 2000 m a.s.l. during the day. An influx of warm air will cause waterlogging and a reduction in snow stability, especially at middle altitudes (up to 1800 m a.s.l.). Minor avalanches and avalanches from wet snow are expected, possibly even medium-sized wet avalanches."
