Isolated danger zones prevail at high altitudes: older snowdrift accumulations which can trigger on steep slopes in extended eastern aspects, behind discontinuities and in gullies which can trigger small slab avalanches. Due to poor visibility and covering by some fresh snow, potential danger zones are difficult to recognize. The likelihood decrease as the day unfolds, limited to steep rocky terrain. On steep grass-covered slopes, isolated glide-snow avalanches are still possible.",

The old snowpack is compact, moist at intermediate altitudes, and instable. At high altitudes it is losing its firmness because of solar radiation.
