Glide-snow avalanches can trigger at any time of day or night and grow to larger size. Danger zones occur near ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, esp. on steep shady slopes the older drifts are often trigger-prone. Small-to-medium slab avalanches and also loose-snow avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading. In high alpine regioins the danger zones are more frequent.",
