        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 1500 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Main problem: wet snow. On very steep slopes with smooth ground that have not yet discharged glide snow avalanches can be expected to trigger naturally at any time. Avoid zones below glide cracks. In extremely steep terrain, wet and moist loose snow avalanches will release in addition. At higher altitudes wet avalanches attain medium-size.\r\nIn addition beware snowdrifts at high altitudes. Avalanche prone locations are found in steep ridgeline terrain in N/E/S aspects and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Here, isolated small to medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by minimal additional loading. Size and frequency of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude.",
