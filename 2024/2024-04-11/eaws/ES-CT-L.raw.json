      "comment" : "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions mostly, but the avalanche danger will increase later. On very steep sunny slopes small moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected above approximately 2000 m. <br/> In addition the clearly visible wind slabs of Monday are prone to triggering in very isolated cases still. These can in some cases be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

      "comment" : "The wind slabs are located on a brown crust due to the effect of Saharan dust. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 20 to 70 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes only a little snow is lying."
