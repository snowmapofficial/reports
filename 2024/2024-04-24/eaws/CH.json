A total of 1 to 1.5 m of snow has fallen in the north, and up to around 2 m in some regions. Avalanches may be triggered there, especially in the new and drift snow layers that are closer to the surface. Towards the south, the total amount of new snow is decreasing appreciably. However, in the areas with slightly less new fallen snow, a layer with a crystal structure is sometimes visible at the transition to the old snowpack in the snowpack model. So far, this has hardly been confirmed in the field. In all regions, the amount of new snow increases significantly with altitude and may considerably exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially in the regions of the north with a lot of new snow, and particularly on slopes that were bare prior to these snowfalls.</p>"

A total of 1 to 1.5 m of snow has fallen in the north, and up to around 2 m in some regions. Avalanches may be triggered there, especially in the new and drift snow layers that are closer to the surface. Towards the south, the total amount of new snow is decreasing appreciably. However, in the areas with slightly less new fallen snow, a layer with a crystal structure is sometimes visible at the transition to the old snowpack in the snowpack model. So far, this has hardly been confirmed in the field. In all regions, the amount of new snow increases significantly with altitude and may considerably exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially in the regions of the north with a lot of new snow, and particularly on slopes that were bare prior to these snowfalls.</p>"

A total of 1 to 1.5 m of snow has fallen in the north, and up to around 2 m in some regions. Avalanches may be triggered there, especially in the new and drift snow layers that are closer to the surface. Towards the south, the total amount of new snow is decreasing appreciably. However, in the areas with slightly less new fallen snow, a layer with a crystal structure is sometimes visible at the transition to the old snowpack in the snowpack model. So far, this has hardly been confirmed in the field. In all regions, the amount of new snow increases significantly with altitude and may considerably exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially in the regions of the north with a lot of new snow, and particularly on slopes that were bare prior to these snowfalls.</p>"
