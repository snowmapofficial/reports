Above 2000 m there are still danger zones where isolated slab avalanches can be triggered at entries into shady-slopes steep gullies (medium-sized). Below 2000 m on steep S/E facing slopes, naturally triggered set loose-snow and glide-snow avalanches can be expected, possible at any time of day or night.",

The slopes at intermediate and lower altitudes are becoming bare of snow."
