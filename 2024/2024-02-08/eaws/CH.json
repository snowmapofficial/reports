However, that surface sometimes has an angular structure and is unfavourable for the arriving snowfall, especially on north-facing slopes that are at a distance from ridgelines and protected from the wind. New snow and snowdrift are prone to triggering. As the additional load of new snow increases, avalanches may also be triggered in deeper layers of the old snowpack in places. In the north, strong southerly winds will lead to the formation of wind slabs, some of which will be prone to triggering.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still to be expected. This applies particularly to east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely to north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in regions with a lot of snow.</p>"
