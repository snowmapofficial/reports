        "SnowDistribution": "Wind scoured and bare on aspects Icy paths and hillsides. Cold clear conditions.  Winds approximately 10 - 20 mph.",
        "Comment": "Significant snow on the way during forecast period. The anticipated amounts are uncertain but greatest accumulations will be East of the A93.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be near continuous snow at all levels throughout the forecast period with greatest accumulations in the East of the forecast area. Winds will be gale force Easterly and the freezing level around 500 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Windslab will accumulate in any areas sheltered from the wind. Most affected will be corrie rims and the tops of gullies on South-West to North-West aspects above 800 metres where accumulations will develop on top of a layer of unstable wind blown surface hoar. On these aspects fragile cornices will rapidly develop. Much of the new snow will fall on bare ground. Wind exposed slopes will be scoured. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A very cold and dry day with light Easterly winds. Early morning valley temperatures around -9C.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The remaining snowpack, primarily above 900 metres on North to East aspects is well bonded and very hard underfoot. Isolated drifts of wind blown surface hoar were observed on sheltered Westerly aspects. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will progressively build mainly on Westerly to Northerly aspects above 900 metres. Areas most affected will be steep wind sheltered terrain where accumulations have gained depth. Fragile cornices will develop above the same aspects. Isolated pockets of unstable windslab will develop on West to North aspects at lower elevations. Elsewhere, the old snowpack will be wind scoured and remain firm and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

However, weaknesses persist in pockets of windslab on steep N through E to SE aspects, largely above 800 metres, although these are mostly avoidable.
