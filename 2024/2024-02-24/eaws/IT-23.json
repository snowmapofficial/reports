        "comment": "Since Friday the wind has been moderate at times in particular along the border with France and along the border with Switzerland. <br/> As a consequence of wind from westerly directions, sometimes deep wind slabs formed in the last two days. <br/> They can be released easily by a single winter sport participant, especially on very steep slopes, caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Reports filed by observers and artificially triggered avalanches have confirmed this situation. <br/> Remotely triggered avalanches are possible in isolated cases, especially along the border with France. <br/> Backcountry touring calls for meticulous route selection. Maintaining distances between individuals and one-at-a-time descents are recommended. <br/> Natural avalanches: Dry slab avalanches and dry loose snow avalanches are possible in isolated cases as before, especially adjacent to ridgelines.",
