A very large quantity of fresh snow and the sometimes large wind slabs that are being formed by the strong to storm force southerly wind can be released very easily in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. Individual occasionally large natural avalanches are possible, especially in case of releases originating from very steep high-altitude shady starting zones. Avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size in particular on very steep west, north and east facing slopes. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular above approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> On steep grassy slopes medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible as a consequence of the new snow, especially on sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for great caution and restraint.",
