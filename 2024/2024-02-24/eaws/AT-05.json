Slabs can trigger by minimum additional loading and grow to large size. If visibility permits, drifts are easily recognized. Winter sports in outlying terrain require much experience and self-restraint in route selection. Heed imperative to danger signs, e.g. whumpf noises, shooting cracks, snow plumes.\r\nIn steep terrain, naturally triggered loose-snow avalanches are possible, also slablike releases.\r\nGlide-snow activity are still a threat. Snow can glide naturally over steep smooth ground, mostly small releases but can grow to large size. Avoid zones below glide-cracks.",
