          <avActivityHighlights>Heed danger of falling and being hurt when exercising wintersports due to lacking snow base!</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above 1600 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Snowdrifts can be a problematic in isolated cases and can in places be triggered as slab avalanches even by low additional loading such as by a single skier. Avalanche prone locations occur in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines in NW-N-SE aspects. Slab avalanches can reach medium size.&#13;
Wet snow is also a problem. Small wet loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep rocky and rugged terrain, especially in the sun.&#13;
In addition there is a danger of small glide snow avalanches on very steep slopes with smooth ground.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Far up into intermediate altitudes the snow that has fallen on Friday was deposited on ground that had previously become bare of snow again. In many places a thin nocturnal melt-freeze crust forms. Bonding of the recently fallen new snow with the old snow is good. At higher altitude on the shady side there are in places intermediate layers in the snowdrifts accumulated on Friday that are prone to triggering. Where winds intensify locally, small snowdrifts accumulate in the afternoon that are prone to triggering. Warming and solar radiation are triggers for loose snow avalanches. The snowpack base is wet which promotes gliding of the snowpack on steep slopes over smooth ground. Gliding snow activity increases slightly as compared to the last weeks.</snowpackStructureComment>

          <avActivityHighlights>Caution due to lacking snow base: In many places at intermediate altitudes danger of falling and being hurt!</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger above 1600 m is considerable, below that altitude danger is low. The main problem are snowdrifts which in places can be triggered by minimum additional loading such as a single skier. Avalanche prone locations occur in particular in very steep terrain in NW-N-SE aspects as well as wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and size increase with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can grow to medium size.&#13;
In addition, wet snow is problematic. Moist or wet loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in  all aspects, especially on the sunny side. Loose snow avalanches attain medium size.&#13;
On very steep slopes with smooth ground there is in addition a risk that small glide snow avalanches release spontaneously.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Up to intermediate altitudes the snow that has fallen on Friday was deposited on ground that had previously become bare of snow again. In many places a thin superficial melt-freeze crust forms during the night. The lower half of the old snowpack is thoroughly moist and stable up to high altitudes. At higher altitudes there are in places trigger-sensitive intermediate layers embedded in the snowdrifts accumulated on Friday and underneath last week's melt-freeze crusts. Where winds intensify locally, fresh snowdrift accumulations will be generated in the afternoon that are prone to triggering. Warming and solar radiation are triggers for loose snow avalanches. The snowpack base is wet which promotes gliding of the snowpack on steep slopes over smooth ground. Gliding snow activity increases slightly as compared to the last weeks.</snowpackStructureComment>

          <avActivityHighlights>Slab avalanche danger increases with ascending altitude. Heed danger of natural releases in sun-exposed steep terrain!</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>On the main Allgäu ridgee avalanche danger above 1600 m is considerable, danger below that altitude is moderate. The main problem are snowdrifts which can in places be triggered as slab avalanches even by low additional loading such as by a single skier. Avalanche prone  are found on steep northwest to north to southeast facing slopes adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and size increase with ascending altitude. Slab avalanches can reach medium size.&#13;
There is a risk that mostly medium-sized glide snow avalanches release spontaneously on very steep slopes over smooth ground. Isolated glide snow avalanches can grow to large size. Avoid zones below glide cracks.&#13;
In addition, small to medium-sized loose snow avalanches can trigger naturally in extremely steep rocky and rugged terrain. Avalanche prone locations occur in all aspects, however predominantly in the sun.</avActivityComment>
