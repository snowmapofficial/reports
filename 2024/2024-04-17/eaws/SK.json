This will bring cloudy, overcast weather with snow showers, which will be of a snowy nature from the mid-latitudes onwards. In the High Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger above 2100 m above sea level. Due to strong winds and new snowfalls, the main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially the leeward sides of the highest ridges, narrow leeward couloirs on the S, SE and E orientations are dangerous. In these places it is possible to find locally wind-blown slabs of different hardness. They can be loosened especially on steep slopes under high additional loads. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",
