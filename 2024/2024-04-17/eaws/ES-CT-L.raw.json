The more recent wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust."

The wind slabs will be deposited on a crust in all aspects above approximately 2000 m. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
