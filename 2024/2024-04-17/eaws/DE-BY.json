Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered by 1 person in steep ridgeline terrain in N/ES aspects as well as behind abrupt changes in the terrain and in gullies bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size, at high altitude avalanche prone locations are more frequent.\r\nIn addition, the number of naturally releasing glide snow avalanches increases, in particular on steep grassy slopes that have previously been bare of snow. Glide snow avalanches can attain medium size.",
