        "comment": " Main problem is still the danger of glide-snow avalanches which can release at any time on sunny slopes up to 2600 m and grow to medium size. In zones where there is rain impact gliding snow activity will be heightened. Caution below glide cracks. Favorable touring conditions prevail in outlying terrain, with low avalanche danger.  Beware small drifts in high-altitude ridgeline terrain, gullies, bowls. In extremely steep terrain, older snowdrift accumulations can trigger small avalanche. Caution: acute danger of falling. Beware cornices on ridges.",
        "highlights": "Glide-snow avalanches persist. Small fresh snowdrifts at high altitudes."

        "comment": "At high altitudes 5-10 cm of fresh snow is anticipated. Due to wind impact, fresh (usually small) snowdrift accumulations will be generated. Fresh and small drifts lie deposited atop a stable old snowpack. Warm ground and the moist-to-wet snowpack up to high altitudes continue to reinforce gliding movements, as numerous observed glide-snow avalanches confirm. At very high altitudes the uppermost part of the snowpack evidences weak layers, only seldom triggerable."
