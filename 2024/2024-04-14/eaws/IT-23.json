        "comment": "In some regions light snowfall at intermediate altitudes. The surface of the snowpack will only just freeze. The spring-like weather conditions will give rise to thorough wetting of the snowpack, in the event of prolonged bright spells especially in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Wet avalanches can sometimes be released by a single winter sport participant. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> In starting zones where no previous releases have taken place and at intermediate and high altitudes individual medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large moist and wet avalanches are possible. These can also be released in near-ground layers. <br/> <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur, in particular on very steep grassy slopes. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible.",
        "highlights": "The weather will be cloudy in some regions. Wet snow represents the main danger."
