        "comment": "The weather will be mild. As a consequence of warming, the activity of small and medium moist avalanches has gradually increased. This applies in particular on very steep slopes above approximately 2000 m, as well as at the base of rock walls. In addition from the late morning in all aspects, an increasing number of medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large wet avalanches are possible. In particular on shady slopes the avalanches can penetrate even deep layers. The clearly visible wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in all aspects at high altitude. Backcountry tourers or freeriders can release avalanches easily.",
        "highlights": "The weather will be partly cloudy. As a consequence of warming during the day the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent."
