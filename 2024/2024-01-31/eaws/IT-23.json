        "comment": "A mostly favourable avalanche situation will prevail. Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. <br/> Small avalanches: They can be released in near-surface layers by large loads. These avalanche prone locations are very rare and are barely recognisable, even to the trained eye. Transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack where hard layers are lying on a weakly bonded old snowpack are unfavourable. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise in the early morning to slight moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. As the temperature drops hardly any moist avalanches are possible in the afternoon.",
        "highlights": "The backcountry touring conditions in the morning, after a clear night, are mostly favourable."

        "comment": "In the last eight days the weather was mild. <br/> Steep south, west and southeast facing slopes,: Towards its surface, the snowpack is hard and its surface has a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. <br/> Below approximately 2000 m only a little snow is lying on south and southwest facing slopes. Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Also adjacent to ridgelines hardly any snow is lying. <br/> Along the border with Switzerland in some localities 5 cm of snow will fall in the evening above approximately 2000 m."
