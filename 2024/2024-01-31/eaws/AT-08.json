Near-surface layers and older drifts are still prone to triggering. Such danger zones occur mostly in transitions from shallow to deeper snow or on heavily wind-loaded slopes. Avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading and grow to medium size. Backcountry sports require prudent route selection.  Caution urged near cornices. The situation is more critical at high altitudes, loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. in steep sunny and rocky tererain. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",

On steep sunny slopes the uppermost layers of the snowpack are often melt-freeze encrusted and capable of bearing loads. Bonding is mostly adequate, sometimes with blanketed graupel. Fractures in more deeply embedded layers of the snowpack have not been registered recently. In early morning often a hard-to-icy surface. The warm ground and the moist-to-wet snowpack are reinforcing gliding snow movement."
