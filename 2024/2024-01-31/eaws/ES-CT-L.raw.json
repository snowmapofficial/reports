    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften later than the day before. <br/> Shady slopes: As a consequence of falling temperatures and low relative humidity the snowpack became faceted during the last few days and has therefore lost strength. It is largely stable and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a resilient crust. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
