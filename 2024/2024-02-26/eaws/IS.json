Weaknesses higher up in the snowpack likely subsided during the warm spell, but deeper weaknesses near the older firn are likely still presen. Stability tests showed fractures at moderate to high stress on that layer. Compression tests showed that the layer breaks easily, and faceted crystals are still present. However, significant stress or warming is likely needed for an avalanche to occur on that layer, as the upper layers will likely stiffen further as the temperatures cool down this week."
