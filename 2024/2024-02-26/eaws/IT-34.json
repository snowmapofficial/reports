        "comment": "Major snowfall is expected on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday. The snow/rain limit will initially be low (800-1000 m) but will then gradually rise to the expected 1400-1600 m in the Dolomites and the 1600-1800 in the Pre-Alps. Therefore, the first snow will be dry and the late event snow will be wetter at least up to 2000 m elevation. 30 to 45 cm of snow is expected at 1500 m in the Dolomites (40-65 cm at 2000 m) and in the Pre-Alps 10 to 35 cm with amounts as high as 80 cm at 2000 m. The avalanche danger from Tuesday is 4-strong for spontaneous avalanches of fresh and often wet snow that, along usual routes, may reach even low altitudes. Avalanche activity will be widespread between 1,600 and 2,000 m above sea level, including along the northern slopes. Large avalanches are also expected sa Tuesday afternoon and by Wednesday. Frequent skidding avalanches below 1800 m altitude are also to be expected.",

        "comment": "By Tuesday afternoon, it is likely that expected avalanches could widely affect man-made areas even at sites not usually exposed to avalanche danger. These are medium to high magnitude events. Conditions for hiking and snow descents as of Tuesday are critical. People are urged to stay on open trails and to rely on mountain professionals for open field hiking. Visibility will be reduced with the added difficulty of spotting dangerous areas."
