Here soft wind slabs formed. <br/> The wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant above approximately 2000 m. These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> <br/> On extremely steep slopes and at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain individual natural dry avalanches are possible, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases.",
