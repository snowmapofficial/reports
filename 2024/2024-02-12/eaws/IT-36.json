As a consequence of the strong southerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations formed. <br/> On steep sunny slopes the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. As a consequence of solar radiation the avalanche prone locations will become more prevalent as the day progresses. <br/> Several large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are possible in the regions with a lot of snow. <br/> The new snow and wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant.",
