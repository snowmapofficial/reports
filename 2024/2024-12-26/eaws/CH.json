However, the heavy layer of snow covering the weakly bonded old snow on the northern flank of the Alps and in northern and western Valais will have a positive effect in the coming days and the probability of triggering in the old snowpack will decrease. The situation is more critical in southern Valais, as well as in a strip from northern Ticino through northern Grisons and the northern regions of central Grisons to Lower Engadine. There, the weakly bonded old snow is covered by around 50 to 80 cm of snow. South of this region, in the southern areas of central Grisons, southern Grisons and central Ticino, there is still little snow. There, with the strong northerly wind, wind slabs were deposited on a thin, almost completely faceted and loose snowpack. These are prone to triggering.</p>"
