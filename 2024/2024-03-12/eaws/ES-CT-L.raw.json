      "comment" : "The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence in particular on steep north and east facing slopes and above the tree line. The wind slabs are sometimes deep but can be released easily especially at their margins. Sometimes they are medium-sized. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more dry and moist snow slides are to be expected as the day progresses, even medium-sized ones. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected. <br/> <br/> The conditions are sometimes treacherous for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities. The current avalanche situation calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "30 to 60 cm of snow has fallen since Friday. The sometimes strong wind has transported the new snow significantly. <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are lying on weak layers in particular on wind-protected shady slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. The various wind slabs have bonded poorly with each other and the old snowpack. Released avalanches and field observations confirm the complex avalanche situation in particular on wind-loaded slopes. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be good. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to rapid moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 90 to 130 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."
