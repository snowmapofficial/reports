        "Summary": "GC for 13/3. Thaw conditions overnight followed by drier colder day with good stability. Low hazard.",
        "SnowDistribution": "Gradually diminishing snowpack in thaw conditions.  Cloudy on the tops most of the day.  Winds 20-30 mph strongest in the afternoon.",
        "Comment": "Strong winds on Wednesday are forecast to ease to give a calmer day on Thursday before milder conditons and rain return Thursday evening.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild with heavy rain at all levels overnight, rain turning  to snow above around 800 metres as precipitation clears to give a drier colder day. Gale force winds will be mainly South-Westerly. Daytime freezing level will be around 950 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "A period of significant thaw overnight. During this period wet snow surface instabilities are possible on steep slopes and all remaining cornices will be prone to collapse. During daylight hours, remaining snow will start to become firmer in the drier colder conditions and stability will be good. Any new snow accumulations, as the temperature drops, are not expected to be significant. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry, cloudy day. The freezing level was around 1000 metres in the morning, rising above all summits during the afternoon. Moderate South-Easterly winds increased in strength during the day.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded and stable in most locations. Thaw conditions are prevailing with any shallow new snow deposits above 1000 metres quickly consolidating. Remaining cornices are becoming weaker in the milder temperatures. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Breakable rain crust above 900 metres, fresh snow above.  No visibility throughout the day above 800 metres. Winds approx 10-20 mph but with some stronger gusts on lower slopes.",
        "Comment": "A period of instability overnight due to rain, followed by a stabilising trend during daylight hours as the snow becomes firm.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Precipitation is expected as rain at all levels, before transitioning to light snow above 800 metres. Winds will initially be very strong from the South-East, before veering to the South-West and becoming storm force. The freezing level will be above the summits overnight falling gradually to around 900 metres by midday.",
        "SnowStability": "Wet snow instabilities will quickly develop overnight as rain saturates the snowpack. Steep terrain on all aspects will be affected above 900 metres and crag aprons at lower elevations may be threatened by avalanche run-out. During the day isolated accumulations of windslab will develop on North to East aspects above 950 metres. In other locations stability will improve as the snowpack becomes firm above 900 metres. Cornices will be prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light snow fell at summit level overnight before transitioning to light rain at all levels. Winds were predominately from a South-Easterly direction with strong gusts at midday. The freezing level was above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is well bonded and stable in most locations. At lower elevations the snow is consolidated but soft, while above 900 metres an icy crust was present due to a period of freezing rain. Isolated areas of windslab are present in steep gully tops and scarp slopes of a West through North to North-East aspect above 1100 metres. These deposits are shallow and avoidable in many cases. Remaining cornices are weak. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Significant thaw conditions overnight with heavy rain, then a brief spell of summit snow on the back edge of the cold front.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight the freezing level will be well above the summits, later dropping to around 900 metres. A period of heavy rain is expected initially, turning to snow on the summits briefly in the morning, then mainly dry through the day. Gale force South-Westerly winds.",
        "SnowStability": "Significant thaw conditions will lead to a period of instability overnight. Wet snow instabilities will be present mainly above 900 metres on West through North to East aspects. Cornices will be weak and prone to collapse. Later, isolated and shallow deposits of windslab will develop on North to East aspects above 900 metres. This will be followed by a stabilising trend throughout the day. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Isolated shallow pockets of windslab on West to North aspects above 1000 metres are consolidating. Greatest snow cover is above 750 metres. Existing cornices are weakening as the freezing level rises. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Expect very challenging weather in the mountains tomorrow. Not a great day to be on the summits. Winds easing overnight into Thursday and remaining mild.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight rain at all levels will ease into light wintry showers by daybreak, with snow to 600 metres briefly early morning. Fresh South-East winds will veer South-West overnight, strengthening, becoming gale force to storm force on exposed summits by midday, easing slightly later. The freezing level will dip to 700 metres early morning, gradually rising to summit level through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight, the existing moist snowpack will continue to thaw at all levels, but will remain well consolidated and stable throughout, re-freezing later. During the day, a small amount of new snow is expected, mostly accumulating in isolated pockets of windslab, on sheltered North to East aspects generally above 800 metres. Thaw conditions will return to all levels by the end of the day. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A largely dry, mild and bright day. Light South-East winds initially, gradually strengthening. A rising freezing level at 900 metres by late morning.",

Minor wet snow instabilities noted in deeper accumulations, North-West to North aspects above 800 metres. Otherwise, the existing snowpack is well consolidated, firm and stable throughout, with most snow on North to East aspects above 800 metres, mainly on the inland ranges.

Limited risk of minor surface instability on steeper terrain, mainly on West to North aspects above 900 metres.

The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

Isolated areas of instabilities will linger on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres. Areas most affected will be gully tops, coire rims and steep wind sheltered locations. Cornices will be found on these aspects and will be prone to collapse, especially overnight. Loss of snow at lower elevations. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
