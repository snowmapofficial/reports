These can in isolated cases be released by people. <br/>",

        "comment": "A great many small and medium-sized gliding avalanches and moist snow slides have been released in the last few days. Some snow fell today in some localities. The sometimes moderate wind has transported only a little snow. <br/> In particular sunny slopes: Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on steep slopes. Shady slopes: The old snowpack remains moist. As a consequence of falling temperatures low relative humidity the snowpack will consolidate. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
