        "comment": "In the regions of the north exposed to the foehn wind 0 to 5 cm of snow will fall. In these regions small wind slabs will form. They are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and generally at high altitudes. These can at their margins be released by people. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of falling temperatures a crust will form on the surface during the night. <br/> The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to slight softening of the snowpack on very steep sunny slopes below approximately 2500 m. Only isolated moist loose snow slides are to be expected, in particular at the base of rock walls. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",

        "comment": "Snow depths vary greatly at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions, depending on the infuence of the wind. At low and intermediate altitudes only a little snow is lying. <br/> The weather conditions gave rise to favourable bonding of the snowpack over a wide area. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. The weather conditions will cause a slight weakening of the near-surface layers as the day progresses in particular on very steep sunny slopes."
