A high temperature gradient has been measured in the snowpack after thaw on Monday, followed by cold weather. The weaknesses may continue to develop in the upper and lower layers of the snowpack in the ongoing cold over the next few days. Stability tests have shown fractures with light to moderate loads in the new snow. Propagation saw tests indicated that older weakness still breaks fairly easily, and faceted crystals are still present. However, significant stress is required for an avalanche to occur on that layer since the upper layers have stiffened and bridged the lower layers after thawing."
