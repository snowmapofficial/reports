        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. Due to smoe fresh snow and wind, fresh, thin snowdrift accumulations are being generated, deposited mostly near ridges and in steep gullies and bowls where they can trigger by one person above 2400 m. Avalanches in snowdrifts are usually small-to-medium. On very steep N/E/W facing slopes above 2400 m, also weak layers in the old snow can trigger by large additional loading. Slabs can become large-sized. Caution in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls.\r\nDue to rain impact the snowpack is becoming wetter. In steep grass-covered terrain, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time, esp. below 2400 m. Glide-snow avalanches are usually small, occasionally larger higher up.",
