        "SnowDistribution": "Deep drifting in places at mid mountain level. Good visibility during the day when not engulfed in drifting snow squalls.  Winds approx 40 - 50 mph, easing slightly in the afternoon.",
        "Comment": "Remaining cold.  Although no new snow is forecasted, there will be redistribution of any existing unconsolidated snow with the change in wind direction.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A dry day is forecasted.  Winds, generally from the South will ease overnight becoming light Easterlies by the end of the day. The freezing level will fluctuate around 600 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Unstable windslab will continue to build on North to East aspects above 850 metres. Areas most affected will be steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims, gullies and gully tops, especially where overlying the old snow. Fragile cornices will also be found on these aspects. Later in the day, isolated areas of unstable windslab will build on West and North-West aspects but accumulations are not expected to be significant. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Fresh accumulations of poorly bonded windslab has developed on North to East aspects above 850 metres.  Areas most affected are steep wind sheltered locations such as coire rims, gullies and gully tops. Fragile cornices have started to build on the same aspects. Below this height a thin covering of fresh snow is mainly overlying bare ground but where accumulations have gained depth, instabilities are present. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",
