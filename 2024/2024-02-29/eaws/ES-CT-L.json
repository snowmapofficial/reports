        "comment": "The fresh snow of Tuesday as well as the extensive wind slabs are lying on soft layers on northwest, north and east facing slopes and in all altitude zones. In very isolated cases the avalanches are large and can be released easily also by a single winter sport participant. Shady slopes where weaknesses exist in the old snowpack are especially precarious. <br/> <br/> 10 cm of snow will fall in the next few hours above approximately 1500 m. Adjacent to ridgelines soft wind slabs will form. This snow and in particular the wind slabs can be released easily, or, in isolated cases naturally in all aspects and in all altitude zones. The avalanches are only small but in many cases easily released. <br/> <br/> Outside marked and open pistes a precarious avalanche situation will prevail. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate defensive route selection.",
        "highlights": "Weakly bonded old snow on northwest, north and east facing slopes. In addition a certain danger of dry snow slides and avalanches exists."
