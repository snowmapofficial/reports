        "comment": "More natural avalanches are possible, in particular medium-sized ones, especially in steep rocky terrain, as well as adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above the tree line. In steep gullies in the regions with a lot of snow the avalanches can in isolated cases reach low altitudes. Even single backcountry tourers can release avalanches in some places. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, as well as at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain in particular at high altitude. The avalanche prone locations are prevalent and are difficult to recognise. Gliding avalanches are also to be expected. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and careful route selection.",
        "highlights": "New snow and gliding snow represent the main danger. Backcountry touring calls for caution."

The large quantity of fresh snow as well as the wind slabs are in some cases still prone to triggering at intermediate and high altitudes. The snowpack will be in most cases moist."
