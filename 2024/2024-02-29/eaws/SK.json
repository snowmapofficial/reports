Wet snow is a defining avalanche problem especially in the afternoon. Avalanche release is possible especially with high additional loads, but spontaneous wet avalanches are also expected on very steep slopes. Gliding  avalanches can also occur on the grassy slopes of southern exposures and can threaten valley routes. At the highest altitudes of the Tatra Mountains (above 2000 m), a slab avalanche is possible on the steep slopes of the northern exposures, especially under high additional loads.",
