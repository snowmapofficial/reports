        "comment": "Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day there will be an increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. Below approximately 2800 m medium-sized to large wet loose snow avalanches are possible. In particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain sometimes large wind slabs formed.",
        "highlights": "The fresh snow and the sometimes large wind slabs can be released easily or naturally in all aspects."
