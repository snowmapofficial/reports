      "comment" : "As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of moist avalanches to level 2 (moderate). In particular on very steep sunny slopes numerous small moist loose snow avalanches are to be expected above approximately 2000 m. <br/> In addition the clearly visible wind slabs of yesterday are prone to triggering in some cases. These can in some places be released by people, but they will be small in most cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2000 m. <br/> Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."
