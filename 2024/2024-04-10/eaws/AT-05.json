Rising temperatures and solar radiation will increase loose-snow avalanches triggering naturally in very steep sunny terrain and in general in rough and rocky terrain in all aspects. Loose snow avalanches can often sweep along great masses of wet old snow and reach larger size.\r\nGlide-snow avalanches remain a danger: in all aspects and at any time of day or night, medium releases in terrain which has not yet discharged, sometimes larger, esp. on N/E facing slopes where there is adequate snow on the ground. Avoid zone below glide cracks. Glide-snow avalanches can also release in terrain where before the snowfall the ground was bare.",
