The surface hoar and faceted crystals are potential weak layers, also the still loose fresh snow. The old snowpack beneath them is compact, without marked weak layers.\r\nThe snowpack surface is highly diverse, often a hard challenge for skiers, alternating wind crusts, swirls, hardened and icy surfaces. In wind-protected shady terrain and wooded zones there is also loose powder (due to cold, and good outgoing nocturnal radiation beneath clear skies)."

Danger zones near ridges, at entries into gullies and bowls, behind discontinuities. Instable snowdrifts have accumulated in exposed zones, triggerable as small-to-medium slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading. On shady steep high-altitude slopes, also large avalanches can be triggered (start of a persistent weak layer problem). Windblown surfaces are often icy and hard, acute danger of falling.",
