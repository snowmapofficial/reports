        "Comment": "The cold Northerly air stream is expected to continue for the next few days. Only a trace of new snow expected over the next 24 hours.",

        "SnowStability": "The widespread friable crust will remain present, this will be more fragile on Easterly aspects above 1000 metres.  Isolated pockets of shallow unstable windslab will begin to develop on wind sheltered East to South aspects above 800 metres.  Areas most affeced will be gully exits and coire rims.  Isolated and avoidable instabilities will persist on very steep Westerly aspects above 1100 metres.  Elsewhere the snowpack will be well bonded and stable.   The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

This is most Fragile above 1000 metres on some wind Sheltered Easterly aspects where it overlies a thin soft layer of snow.  Instabilities persist on very steep Westerly aspects above 1100 metres; however these are isolated, shallow and avoidable.  Elsewhere the snowpack is generally well bonded and stable.

        "WeatherInfluences": "A strengthening Northerly air flow will affect the area with the freezing level lowering to around 200 metres. Mostly dry through the day with a very light snow shower likely towards late afternoon. Winds will mainly be North-Westerly, fresh at first becoming strong during the day.",

The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "Last night the snowpack was subject to a slight thaw then a refreeze. A light dusting of new snow fell mainly above 950 metres these new deposits are not deep or extensive with most accumulations being on North-East to South-Easterly aspects above 950 metres.
