        "comment": "As a consequence of a strong wind from northwesterly directions, mostly small wind slabs will form on Sunday. They are in some cases prone to triggering. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep slopes above approximately 2500 m and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In particular at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions these avalanche prone locations are more widespread and the danger is slightly greater. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in particular in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls. <br/> <br/> The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Rapid decrease in danger as the temperature drops. Hardly any more moist and wet avalanches are possible. Gliding avalanches are possible however still in isolated cases.",
        "highlights": "Fresh and older wind slabs represent the main danger."

These harsh wintry weather conditions gave rise to rapid consolidation of the snowpack over a wide area. <br/> In particular shady slopes high altitudes and the high Alpine regions: The upper section of the snowpack is dry; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow. <br/> A lot of snow is lying at intermediate and high altitudes."
