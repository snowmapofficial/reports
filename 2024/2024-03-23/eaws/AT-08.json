        "comment": "Pay close heed to freshly generated snowdrift accumulations at high altitudes, they are triggerable by 1 person. Danger zones increase in both size and frequency with ascending altitude. In addition, on steep shady slopes in high alpine regions the interim layers inside the old snowpack are often trigger-prone. Medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading there. In high alpine regions the danger zones are more frequent. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. Below 2600 m, glide-snow avaalnches continue to be possible, and can grow to large size where snowfall is heavy.",
