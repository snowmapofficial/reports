      "comment" : "The early morning will see favourable avalanche conditions generally. As the penetration by moisture increases more wet and gliding avalanches are possible as the day progresses. The avalanches can release the entire snowpack and reach medium size in some cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones and on very steep shady slopes below approximately 2200 m. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours should be concluded early."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be quite good. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. Moisture can reach the persistent weak layers buried within the snowpack and reactivate them. This applies in particular in very steep, high-altitude, shady starting zones that still retain some snow."
