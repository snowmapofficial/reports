The snowdrift was widely deposited on loose snow on north-facing slopes, locally also on surface hoar. As a result, the recent wind slabs were often prone to triggering and many were released by people.</p><p>Deep layers of the snowpack are compact in many places. Around the crusts in the upper third of the old snowpack, layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure are deposited. Particularly in the inneralpine regions of Grisons, avalanches were released in these layers above around 2400 m in the past week.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2400 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes.
