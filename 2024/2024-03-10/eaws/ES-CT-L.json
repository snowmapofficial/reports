        "comment": "The fresh snow and in particular the sometimes deep wind slabs can be released very easily in all aspects and at intermediate and high altitudes. In the vicinity of peaks they can be released in the faceted old snow and reach medium size in isolated cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects above approximately 2000 m and in gullies and bowls. <br/> The conditions are treacherous for backcountry touring and other off-piste activities. The current avalanche situation calls for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger and caution.",
        "highlights": "Fresh snow and large quantities of wind-drifted snow represent the main danger."
