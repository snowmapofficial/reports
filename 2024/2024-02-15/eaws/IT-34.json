        "comment": "On Friday it will be very warm over a wide area. The danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase during the day. Below approximately 2600 m small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible. The sometimes strong wind has transported some snow. The wind slabs have formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in the high Alpine regions. The fresh wind slabs can be released by small loads. Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released by winter sport participants in particular on very steep northwest, north and northeast facing slopes. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution.",

The snowpack is largely stable; its surface consists of loosely bonded snow. The high temperatures as the day progresses will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on very steep sunny slopes. Weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on northwest, north and northeast facing slopes."
