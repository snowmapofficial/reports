Only a few avalanche-prone locations are still to be found, especially on shady slopes at a distance from ridgelines and protected from the wind. There, some near-surface layers of the snowpack are lying on angular layers in the area of the old snow surface. In addition, this week's mostly small wind slabs are occasionally prone to triggering.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are also possible in isolated cases. This applies particularly to east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely to north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in some cases in regions with a lot of snow. Occasional moist snow slides and avalanches are also possible due to higher temperatures during the day.</p>"
