The fresh snow and in particular the wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep north, east and southwest facing slopes and generally at intermediate and high altitudes. These are to be found especially in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> In particular in the regions with a lot of snow more mostly small moist and wet avalanches are possible as a consequence of solar radiation.
