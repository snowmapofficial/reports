        "comment": "For winter sports enthusiasts, predominantly favorable conditions prevail with moderate avalanche danger. In high ridgeline terrain, in gullies and bowls, freshly generated snowdrift accumulations require special attentiveness: they are often blanketed by fresher snowdrifts and are trigger-prone. Danger zones increase with ascending altitude. One winter sports enthusiast can trigger a medium-sized slab avalanche. Apart from the dangers of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall also need consideration. Beware cornices on ridges. Glide-snow avalanches are difficult to forecast or estimate. They can trigger in all aspects below 2600 m at any time of day or night and grow to medium size. Caution below glide cracks. Loose-snow slides possible on very steep sunny slopes.",

      "snowpackStructure": {
        "comment": "At high altitudes, older snowdrift accumulations lie mostly atop a stable old snowpack, on steep shady slopes, often atop soft layers. Covered drifts at high altitudes often lie atop a snowpack with weak near-surface layers, are thus prone to triggering. The warm ground and wet snowpack base reinforce gliding snowpack movements. Below 1400 m there is very little snow on the ground."
