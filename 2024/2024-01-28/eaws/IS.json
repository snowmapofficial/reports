In the highest mountains, old weaknesses may still exist. Since Thursday, a bit more snow has been added and new thin wind slabs can have formed where snow accumulates, especially in NW-E aspects, gullies and depressions. On Monday, snow should get moist on the lower parts of slopes but above around 500 m elevation, more snow is forecasted to add and drift in SW winds.
