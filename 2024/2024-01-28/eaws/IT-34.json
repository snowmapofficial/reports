        "comment": "Continuous warming. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be reduced. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. Small moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2800 m. This applies in particular in gullies and bowls in particular above approximately 1500 m, as well as on steep sunny slopes. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> The hard wind slabs are easy to recognise but can be released in isolated cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found also in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Skiers can release avalanches in isolated cases, including medium-sized ones."

        "comment": "More recent wind slabs can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above approximately 1900 m, especially at their margins. The spring-like weather conditions gave rise to moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2400 m. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution and restraint."
