        "Summary": "SC for 29/01 Well bonded and stable snow throughout. Surface layers becoming firm and icy at higher altitudes. Avalanche hazard -Low",
        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snow throughout.  Cloud base was at 700 metres all day.  Winds approx 50-60 mph progess very difficult with potential to be taken off feet.",
        "Comment": "Wet, thawing snow will eventually refreeze at higher elevations becoming firm and icy.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "No precipitation overnight or through the day. Gale force South-South-Westerly winds will ease overnight and veer to become moderate to light Northerlies by midday. The freezing level will lower to 550 metres overnight, settling around 700 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Much colder conditions will start to refreeze the wet snowpack with firm surface layers developing. The remaining snow will be well bonded and stable throughout. Patchy snow below 900 metres. Deeper amounts in high North to East facing corries.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Light precipitation early morning, falling as rain at all levels, eased to give a dry day. Low cloud during the morning, cleared to give brighter conditions during the afternoon. Severe gale, increasing to storm force South-South-Westerly winds. Freezing level above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snow continues to thaw and consolidate at all levels and is generally stable. Localised pockets of slightly less well bonded snow persist in steeper, wind sheltered locations on North through East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres. Any remaining cornices are prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "Becoming colder and calmer on Monday. New snow amounts overnight are not expected to be significant but pockets of fresh windslab will be weakly bonded and any fresh cornices will be fragile.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Very light snow showers and strong Westerly winds will affect the highest slopes overnight. Through the day it will be dry with the freezing level around 700-800 metres. Winds will be light to moderate variable but generally East to South-Easterly.",
        "SnowStability": "A return to colder conditions will start to firm up the older snowpack maintaining good general stability.  Isolated areas of windslab may form overnight in wind sheltered areas such as summit gullies and on North-East to South-Easterly slopes. With only very light snowfall expected windslab accumulations are not expected to be deep or extensive.  Any fresh cornices will be fragile. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "Comment": "Most notable event was the early afternoon temperature of 17.5c in Glen Torridon.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "During the evening the freezing level will fall rapidly from above the highest summits to 600 metres by midnight and remain around there till dusk. After the initial light evening shower falling as snow above 900 metres it will be dry. Winds will be predominantly South-Westerly, gale force initially but moderating progressively to light later in the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Any new snow at the highest levels will be insignificant. Snow cover will be patchy with greatest accumulations on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Remaining snowpack will be well bonded and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Light precipitation falling as rain and summit snow will clear overnight.  Storm force Westerly winds will gradually decrease to become light Southerly during the day.   The freezing level will fall from above the summits to 700 metres overnight, where it will remain for the duration of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The snowpack will continue to consolidate and become well bonded and stable throughout.  This will be most widespread above 800 metres, generally around coire backwalls, rims, shallow gullies and the plateau, ribbons of snow below.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is thawing at all altitudes.  Instabilities remain within deeper accumulations on very steep North through East to South-East aspects, but these are isolated and mostly confined to coire rims and gully exits.  Unstable cornices overhang these aspects.  Elsewhere the snowpack is well bonded and stable throughout.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
