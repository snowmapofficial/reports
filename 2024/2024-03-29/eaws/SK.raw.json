At altitudes above 2000m above sea level, slabs and pillows of wind-blown snow still occur in the eastern and northern troughs and moguls. Warning! In some places, wind-blown snow is deposited on a layer of snowflakes = hidden avalanche danger!\nOn very steep slopes, even medium-sized avalanches can be triggered by large additional mechanical loads.\nOn extremely steep slopes, spontaneous avalanches can be expected on saline slopes due to the continuing warming.\nAvalanche danger needs to be assessed locally in all orientations.",
