Wet snow is the problem which is making danger rise: in extremely steep terrain, esp. on sunny slopes, small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally. On steep smooth slopes which have not yet discharged, moreover, isolated small glide-snow avalnches are possible in all aspects.\r\nAt high altitudes, snowdrifts can be problematic. Danger zones where slabs of medium size can trigger by large additional loading occur on steep north-facing slopes. The drifted masses are easy to recognize.",
