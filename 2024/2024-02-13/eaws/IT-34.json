The new snow of the weekend can be released naturally on very steep sunny slopes above the tree line. This snow can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads in all aspects above approximately 1800 m. The new snow of the last few days is very loosely bonded in particular on shady slopes above approximately 2000 m.",
