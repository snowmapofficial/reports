        "comment": "The wind slabs of the weekend can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. The avalanches are rather small but in many cases easily released. Individual medium-sized avalanches are nontheless possible. At high altitude the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> On steep sunny slopes small wet snow slides and avalanches are possible in all altitude zones.",
        "highlights": "Wind slabs represent the main danger. From the middle of the day moist snow slides are possible."

The wind slabs are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack on shady slopes. <br/> The spring-like weather conditions from the early morning will give rise to rapid moistening of the snowpack on sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 60 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
