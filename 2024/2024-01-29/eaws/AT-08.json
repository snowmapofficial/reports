        "comment": "Predominantly favorable conditions prevail, avalanche danger is moderate. Near-surface layers and older drifts are increasingly prone to triggering at higher altitudes. Danger zones occur esp. in transitions from shallow to deep snow and in heavily wind-loaded terrain. Avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading and grow to medium size.  Backcountry sports require prudent route selection.  Caution urged near cornices. The situation is more critical at high altitudes, loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. in steep sunny and rocky tererain. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",

On steep sunny slopes the uppermost layers are often encrusted and capable of bearing loads, bonding is moderate, often with blanketed graupel. In early morning often a hard-to-icy surface. The warm ground and the moist-to-wet snowpack are reinforcing gliding snow movement."
