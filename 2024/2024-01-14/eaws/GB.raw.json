        "Summary": "NC for 15.1: Very cold. Localised unstable windslab, E, S to SW aspects above 800m. Cross loading. Fragile cornices. Moderate Hazard",
        "SnowDistribution": "Widespread breakable crust, very tiring conditions.  Whiteout conditions presenting challenging and serious conditions.  Winds 30-40 mph, making progress at higher levels difficult.",
        "Comment": "More snowfall arrived than expected.  Some deep drifts developing in lee areas at higher levels.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Light snowfall overnight, this is expected to clear during the morning.  Strong winds will be North-Westerly in direction.  Very cold, freezing at all levels.",
        "SnowStability": "Localised accumulations of poorly bonded windslab will continue to develop on Easterly through South to South-West aspects above 800 meters.  Areas most affected will be coire rims, gully exits, steep roll overs and crag aprons. More isolated windslab will develop on other aspects due to cross loading.  Fragile cornices will continue to build.  A widespread friable crust will remain present on all aspects, beneath a thin cover of snow.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Very cold with snow showers at all levels on strong North-North-Westerly winds.  Summit temperatures fell to minus 7 degrees C.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "New accumulations of localised windslab have developed on Easterly to Southerly aspects above 800 metres.  Cross loading was also observed on North-East aspects.  The greatest instability is on wind sheltered terrain, especially crag aprons, coire rims, gully tops and steep roll overs.  Fragile cornices are developing on these aspects.  A widespread friable crust remains present on all aspects.    The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "It will be cold, the freezing level will lower to all levels by day break. During the night scattered snow showers falling to all levels. Then a mainly dry day but a possibility of an odd isolated snow shower. Winds will be fresh to moderate and mostly North-Westerly easing slightly in the afternoon.",
        "SnowStability": "The older snowpack will remain generally well bonded and stable. New snow amounts are not expected to be significant but some localised and shallow accumulations of new poorly bonded windslab could develop mainly on South-East and South aspects above 800 metres, these are not likely to be deep or extensive. Fragile cornices developing.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Last night, light new snow fell mainly above 800 metres, by dawn it was dry and remained so for most of the day. Some very light snow did start to materialise by late afternoon. Winds were moderate to fresh North-North-Westerly and the freezing level was around 400 metres, mid-day summit temperature was minus five point seven degrees Celsius.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "A light dusting of new snow fell mainly above 800 metres these new deposits are not deep or extensive with most accumulations lying on South-East to Southerly aspects above 800 metres.
