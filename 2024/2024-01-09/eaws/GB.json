Temperature inversion conditions developing but air temperatures will remain sub-zero in the mountains.\nObserved Weather Influences: Light snow to glen level during the evening, followed by a dry day. Very light South-Easterly winds. Cold conditions with -5.5 degrees centigrade recorded at 995 metres during the late morning.\nObservedSnowStability: There is a thin covering of fresh snow to glen level but amounts are negligible. The vast majority of the older snow is firm and well bonded. Pockets of slightly less well bonded windslab persist on mainly South-East to South-West aspects above 800 metres.
