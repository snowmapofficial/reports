        "comment": "The new snow-covered wind slabs of last week remain in some cases prone to triggering in particular on north to east to southwest facing aspects above approximately 2000 m. They can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack here. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate wind from southeasterly directions, mostly small wind slabs will form in the course of the day adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at high altitude. Fresh wind slabs can be released easily. <br/> Especially in extremely steep terrain dry loose snow slides are possible.",
