        "comment": "Restraint is advisable on this first sunny day after a long period of poor weather. <br/> The new snow-covered wind slabs of last week remain in some cases prone to triggering above approximately 2000 m. They can be released by a single winter sport participant. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack here. <br/> As a consequence of new snow and a light to moderate wind from northeasterly directions, mostly small wind slabs will form in the course of the day in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas as well as at high altitude. Fresh wind slabs can be released easily. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation individual avalanches are possible. Especially in extremely steep terrain small and medium sized dry avalanches are possible.",
