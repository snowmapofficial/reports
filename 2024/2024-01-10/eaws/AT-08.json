Danger zones occur on steep ridges, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls,  increase in size and frequency with ascending altitude. Small-to-medium avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally or by 1 person esp. in rocky and sun-drenched steep terrain. Glide-snow avalanches continue to be possible on steep smooth slopes.",

Wind impact has generated easily triggered snowdrift accumulations, as cracks and triggerings today have confirmed. The old snowpack is highly irregular. The warm and wet ground is reinforcing the gliding movement of the entire snowpack, have recently increased in frequency."
