        "comment": "As the temperature drops there will be only a slight decrease in the danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides. In extremely steep terrain only isolated small gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible. <br/> In many places there is a danger of falling on the hard crust.",
        "highlights": "The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable. Gliding avalanches and moist loose snow slides are possible however still in isolated cases."

        "comment": "Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will hardly soften at all. <br/> Shady slopes: Towards its surface, the snowpack is faceted and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a resilient crust. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 30 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
