        "comment": "During Tuesday, the High, Western and Western part of the Low Tatras is in the morning for the highest altitudes (above 1600 m above sea level) an increased avalanche danger, i.e. 3 degree from the 5-part international scale. The weather of the last days (Sunday evening and Monday) - massive precipitation and strong winds, caused instability in many places. The main avalanche problems are new snow (on all exposures) and wind blown snow on E, S, SE, and SW orientations , even on smaller slopes. . Wet snow is the main avalanche problem in the middle and lower elevations. The weather pattern suggests that the wet snow problem will move to higher exposures. The aggravation due to warming, sunlight and possibly additional rainfall even at the highest altitudes will cause the snow profile to become soaked to such an extent that spontaneous avalanches and even spontaneous foundation avalanches are imminent. An increased avalanche danger is therefore also in force for the mid-altitudes in the afternoon."

Due to very strong winds, it was intensively moved to the leeward sides of the mountains or to places with a lower slope. In many places, the wind has created snow pillows and fragile slabs that lie on top of a hard layer of old snow. The large difference in hardness and the brittleness of the slabs of wind-beaten snow have thus caused a high degree of instability in many places."

An influx of warm sea air during Monday, combined with rainfall, caused a gradual heaviness and wetting of the snow cover.  In some places (S,SE,E) of the highest altitudes (above 1400 m above sea level) it is possible to find smaller slabs and pillows of packed snow from the last snowfall period.  However, the main avalanche problem is wet snow, which can be released in the form of spontaneous or spontaneous foundation avalanches. Thus, frequent avalanche paths, places with a high height of accumulated snow and a large collecting area are dangerous.",
