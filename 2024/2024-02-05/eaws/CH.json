The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs are in some cases still prone to triggering. At elevated altitudes these avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent. These are to be evaluated with care and prudence in very steep terrain. <br/> Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls.",

The surface of the snowpack is usually hard and there is very little driftable snow. On south-facing slopes, the surface of the snowpack became moist up to around 2500 m, where a crust froze during the night. There are still isolated weak layers in the old snowpack near the surface above approximately 2500 m, but no avalanches have been reported in the last few days. The bottom section of the snowpack is generally stable.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still possible. This is mainly the case on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below around 2200 m. These avalanches may be large in regions with a lot of snow.</p>"
