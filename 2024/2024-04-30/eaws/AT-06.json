On east and south-facing slopes, isolated wet loose-snow and slab avalanches can be expected during the morning. Later the danger will rise in all aspects to moderate, towards evening esp. increasing naturally triggered wet-snow/glide-snow avalanches in the southern regions due to rainfall.",

        "comment": "The snowpack has settled and to start with is stable. Due to higher temperatures and lacking nocturnal outgoing longwave radiation, a melt-freeze crust can hardly form. As temperatures rise and solar radiation intensifies, the snow quickly becomes slushy and heavy, depending on aspect. In the southern ranges, rainfall will destabilize the snowpack in the evening. The slopes are becoming bare of snow."
