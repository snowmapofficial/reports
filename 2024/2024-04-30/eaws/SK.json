        "comment": "Avalanche danger is bound to the highest positions of the Tatras. The risk is posed by spontaneous avalanches from wet snow, which can break loose on any oriented slope. Due to high temperatures and the absence of night frosts, avalanche activity is possible already in the morning and mid-morning hours. Foundation avalanches may also occur.",
