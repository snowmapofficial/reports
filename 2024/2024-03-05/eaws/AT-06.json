        "comment": "Avalanche danger is low in general. Possible problem: liding snow, on isolatd very steep south-facing slopes above 1900 m can be triggered. Potential starting zones and glide crack zones should be avoided. In addition, on steep north-facing slopes at high altitude large additional loading can trigger a slab avalanche.\r\nIn the afternoon, avalanche danger between Turrach and Koralpe will increase slightly. Triggering of small slab avalanches possible on north-facing slopes by large additional loading above 1700 m.",
