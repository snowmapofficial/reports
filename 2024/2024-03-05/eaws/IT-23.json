During the course of the night they will increase in size additionally. They can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant,. <br/> The snowpack remains unfavourable on shady slopes. <br/> Several medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry and wet avalanches have been released on Monday. On very steep slopes several small and medium-sized avalanches were released. <br/> The weather conditions facilitated a gradual strengthening of the near-surface layers in particular on sunny slopes. The natural activity of dry and wet avalanches has rapidly decreased. Some large and, in isolated cases, very large natural avalanches are still even now possible. This applies in case of releases originating from steep, high-altitude starting zones that still retain some snow, in particular on wind-loaded slopes.",
