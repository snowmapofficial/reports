        "Comment": "Turning colder towards the weekend.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Little change is expected in the weather. It will remain generally dry with gale force South-East winds. The freezing level will be around 1000 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected in the snowpack. It will continue to slowly consolidate in the dry conditions. However, areas of moderately bonded windslab will remain on mainly North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. On other aspects the snowpack will tend to be either hard, icy and stable or very shallow.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is gradually consolidating in the dry conditions. However, some areas of moderately bonded windslab remain. These are generally on North-West to North-East aspects above 900 metres. There was some drifting above this level, but fresh deposits tended not to be significant. Below 900 metres stability is generally good. The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

Localised instabilities will persist on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000m, these will be more isolated on West and East aspects.  The greatest instability will be in steep locations such as coire rims, gully exits, crag aprons and convexities.  Shallow, isolated accumulations of windslab will develop during the day on West to North aspects above 900m.  Cornices will remain unstable.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Localised accumulations of unstable windslab remain on North-West to North-East aspects above 950 metres.  These accumulations are more isolated on West and East aspects.

Isolated pockets of poorly bonded shallow windslab will still remain, mainly on West through North to East aspects above 950 metres.

At lower elevations snow cover will slowly dissipate. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
