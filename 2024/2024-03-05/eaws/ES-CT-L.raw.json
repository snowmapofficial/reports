Sometimes the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized and can be released easily by a single winter sport participant. They are in some cases deep and can be released easily at their margins. <br/> <br/> In addition from midday on east, south and west facing slopes, some small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for careful route selection."

      "comment" : "Shady slopes, intermediate and high altitudes: Faceted weak layers exist in the centre of the snowpack in particular on northwest, north and east facing slopes. Field observations and released avalanches show the unfavourable bonding of the snowpack. <br/> Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will already soften in the late morning. Above approximately 2000 m there are 90 to 120 cm of snow, and even more in some localities."
