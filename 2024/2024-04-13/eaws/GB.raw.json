        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers throughout the forecast period. Colder: freezing at 800m but rising to 1000m by the end of the day. Strong West later South-West winds.",
        "SnowStability": "New moderately stabilised windslab expected on steep North to East aspects. Initially affecting only coire rims and gully tops, later becoming more widespread down to 950m. Some minor new cornice development over steepest lee slopes. The old exposed snowpack in all other locations will refreeze and be well stabilised. Covering of fresh snow down to 800m.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "The very patchy snowpack is wet but well stabilised in most locations. Snow confined to patches above 850m and lower altitudes in some favoured gullies.  Cooler conditions firmed up the snow surface above 1000m as the freezing level fell later in the day.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowStability": "Overnight and through the day localised areas of windslab will develop mainly on North to Easterly aspects above 900 metres. Areas most affected will be steep coire headwalls and sheltered gully exits, particularly where the windslab overlies the old snowpack. Elsewhere the new snow will generally fall on bare ground and will not be a significant avalanche hazard. New cornices will will be soft and fragile. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",

Summit winds were strong from the South-Westerly direction.",

New accumulations of windslab will develop on wind sheltered North through East to South-East aspects above 950 metres.

Windslab will form in wind sheltered locations on North through East to South-East aspects. Above 900 metres, where accumulations acquire depth over refrozen snow-ice they will be unstable. These accumulations are expected to be isolated and generally restricted to gully tops and around corrie rims.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
