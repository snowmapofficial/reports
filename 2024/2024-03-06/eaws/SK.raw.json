Especially dangerous are western orientations, narrow chutes and places under rock walls. Locally, wind-blown snow slabs and pillows may occur. Their release is possible on steep slopes with high additional loads. Below 1800 m avalanche danger is low. The snow cover here is generally well consolidated due to the sub-zero temperatures.",

Occasionally, in leeward exposures above 1800 m above sea level, large amounts of new snow from the last snowfall can be found. At middle and lower elevations, the surface will be hard and load-bearing. Depending on the orientation, continuous snow cover can be found from 1200 m above sea level."
