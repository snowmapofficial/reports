The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases above approximately 2300 m. <br/> As a consequence of solar radiation moist avalanches are possible in the afternoon, but they will be mostly small, in particular on very steep sunny slopes, caution is to be exercised in particular at the base of rock walls.",
