It has been snowing repeatedly in the north over the last 7 days. A total of 1 to 1.5 m of snow has fallen, and in some regions even more. Avalanches may therefore be large. Towards the south, the amount of new snow is decreasing appreciably. In all regions, the amount of new snow increases significantly with altitude and may considerably exceed the amounts described in the avalanche bulletin in the high Alpine regions.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Wet and gliding avalanche activity is currently low. Mostly small gliding avalanches are expected, especially on slopes that had been free of snow prior to these snowfalls.</p>"
