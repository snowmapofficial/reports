Wet snow is the defining avalanche problem. Avalanche release is possible with only a small additional load and spontaneous avalanches are also expected. They will occur mainly on steep slopes and in couloirs where most of the snow fell during the last snowfall. At altitudes up to 2000 m above sea level, gliding avalanches may also occur on grassy slopes.",
