Strong Southerly winds during the snowfall period. 750 metre freezing level overnight, rising to 1800 metres during the afternoon.\nObserved Weather Influences: Light snowfall during the morning above 700 metres, clearing to bright conditions with intermittent snow showers from late morning onwards above 800 metres. Winds were gale force South-Westerly initially, easing to moderate Westerly during the afternoon, but with some stronger gusts. Freezing level rose to around 1000 metres at midday.\nObservedSnowStability: Localised accumulations of moderately bonded windslab have formed in wind sheltered locations only, on mainly North to East aspects above 900 metres. Sharply defined corrie rims and steep gully tops are the locations which are most affected. Small cornices have formed. Elsewhere the old snow is well bonded, with shallow new snow lying mostly on bare ground. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
