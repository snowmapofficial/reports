The snow/rain limit, initially even at 600 m, then rose with rain on snow even above 1200 m elevation.   The activity spontaneous avalanche is expected to be most frequent between 2000 and 1500 m altitude in Agordino, Ampezzano, Arsiero and Recoaro where fresh snowfall contributions have have been greatest. Frequent skidding avalanches are also to be expected along the steep southern grassy slopes below 1,800 m elevation.Detachments caused by slab avalanches may occur already with weak overload.",

        "comment": "From Tuesday afternoon to Thursday, 25-40 cm are still expected at 2000 m in the Dolomites with snow/rain limits rising from 1200 to 1700 m and as much as 60 cm in the Pre-Alps, with snow/rain limits reaching 1700-1900 m i elevation. Avalanche releases will be more likely between 2200 and 1800 m altitude also due to the possible presence of moist surface snow and, may arrive locally and along known routes, at low altitudes. In some areas, expected avalanches may widely affect man-made areas even at sites not usually exposed to avalanche danger. These are medium to high magnitude events. Conditions for hiking and snow descents are critical. People are urged to stay in open trails and to rely on mountain professionals for open field hiking. Visibility will be reduced with the added difficulty of spotting hazardous areas."
