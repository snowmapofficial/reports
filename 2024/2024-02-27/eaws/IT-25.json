        "comment": "The new residual precipitation (snow mixed with rain up to 2000 m) will increase and overload the significant layer of recent snow that has not yet consolidated; the threat rating will remain 4 Strong. Triggering will be possible with low overload on many steep slopes at all aspects. To the south the whole recent snow cover rests, almost entirely, on unfrozen uncovered ground, a condition that will favor it accentuated snow flow phenomena. Numerous natural avalanches both on the ground and on the ground will be possible surface, large and very large in size.",
