Weaknesses in the upper snowpack have likely strengthened during the warm spells, but a deeper weakness near the older firn is likely still present, as stability tests over the weekend showed fractures under moderate to heavy loads. Propagation saw test indicated that the layer breaks easily, and faceted crystals are still present. However, significant stress or warming is likely required for avalanches to release on this layer, as the upper layers have stiffened and bridged the lower layers in most places."
