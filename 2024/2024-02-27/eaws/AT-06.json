Particularly critical: wind-loaded gullies and steep slopes in extended northern aspects, since the drifts here lie deposited atop loose fresh snow. Medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. In addition, isolated medium-sized naturally triggered avalanches are possible. In addition, isolated naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches possible in all aspects.",
