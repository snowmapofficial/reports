        "comment": "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions generally, but the danger of wet and gliding avalanches will increase later. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases. In particular at the southern border of Aran and at high altitude these avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent and the danger is greater. <br/> There is a danger of falling on the hard crust.",
        "highlights": "The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable. Moist snow slides as the day progresses."
