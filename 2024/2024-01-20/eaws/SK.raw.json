Avalanche release is possible here with higher additional loads. Danger spots in the terrain are relatively easy to see for experienced ski mountaineers and climbers, they are located under saddles, ridges, rock walls and in places where the slope changes. At lower and middle altitudes and in places where there is a lack of newer snow, the snow cover is hard to icy after previous temperature changes.",
