Today the freezing level has slowly risen above the highest summits with further intermittent and scattered showers which fell as snow mainly above 900 metres. Thaw conditions and some rain at lower elevations, the South-Westerly winds eased slightly in the afternoon.\nObservedSnowStability: Overnight and through today strong winds and snow showers continued to form further accumulations of unstable windslab. Deeper deposits mainly present on steep North to East aspects above 900 metres, North-West aspects also affected due to cross loading.

Later in the night and through the morning, the freezing level will be around 800 metres, with showers falling as snow above this level.  Early afternoon the freezing level will rise well above the summits with precipitation turning heavy and to rain at all levels. Gale to storm force South-Westerly winds will back to the South.\nObserved Weather Influences: It was a grey day with some periods of drizzle. The freezing level was around 1200 metres with gale force South-Westerly winds.\nObservedSnowStability: Above about 900 meters the surface of the snowpack had started to thaw, but it remained sub-zero at depth. Overall the snowpack is slowly consolidating. However, some instabilities remain on mainly North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Some unstable cornices exist, mainly on these aspects. Below 900 metres the snowpack tends to be wet throughout, and stability is better.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable."
