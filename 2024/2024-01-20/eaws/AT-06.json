        "comment": "Avalanche danger above the treeline is moderate. Danger of slab avalanches is slowly decreasing. The drifts generated on Friday have settled on sunny slopes, the snow is becoming soft through warmth and solar radiation. On shady slopes the settling will take longer. Danger zones increase with ascending altitude, occur behind discontinuities and at entries into gullies and bowls. Snowdrift accumulations can in isolated cases trigger small-to-medium slab avalanches even by 1 person. During the course of the day on steep sunny slopes, small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches cannot be excluded.\r\nIn shady extremely steep terrain and gullies at high altitudes, isolated large-sized avalanches can be triggered (persistent weak layer). Windblown exposed surfaces are often hard and icy, acute danger of falling.",

The NW winds didn\u2019t slacken off until Saturday evening. Snowdrifts occur esp. behind discontinuities on east-facing slopes, where faceted crystals and surface hoar on the encrusted surfaces are potential weak layers. The snowpack base is mostly compact, without marked weak layers; sunny slopes are moist on the surface. Only on steep shady slopes at high altitudes are facted crystals weakening the snowpack fundament."
