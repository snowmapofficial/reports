Wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches can grow to medium size in starting zones where there is enough snow, releases can grow large. With ascending altitude and in high-alpine regions, small fresh and older snowdrift accumulations are still trigger-prone, now blanketed by the most recent fresh fallen snow and difficult to recognize. Small-to-meidum slab avalanches can be triggered by 1 person. Danger zones behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Near-surface layers of the old snowpack are triggerable mostly by large additional loading. Backcountry tours require a cautious route selection. ",
