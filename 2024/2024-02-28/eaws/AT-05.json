Size and frequency of avalanche prone locations increase with ascending altitude. Special caution urged in transitions from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into gullies and bowls.\r\nOn steep grass-covered slopes, gliding snow activity is increasing. Glide-snow avalanches are usually small, occasionally they reach medium size.\r\nDuring the course of the day, increasingly frequent wet loose-snow avalanches are possible in sunny rough and rocky terrain which has not yet discharged.",
