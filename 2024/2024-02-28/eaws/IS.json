A deep persistent weakness, beneath layered snow on older crust, is still present, although stability tests last weekend showed fractures under moderate to heavy loads on that layer. Propagation saw tests indicated that the layer fractures easily, and faceted crystals are still present although starting to round. It will likely require significant stress for avalanches to release on that layer, as the upper layers have stiffened and bridged the lower layers."
