        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2100 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Older snowdrift masses can be triggered mostly by large additional loading, releasing mostly small-to-medium sized slab avalanches. Due to rain impact and mild temperatures, wet-snow avalanches activity on sunny slopes is increasing. In addition, in all aspects, isolated naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
