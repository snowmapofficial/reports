        "comment": "Avalanche danger above 2000 m is moderate, below that altitude danger is low. Due to strong-to-stormy winds, fresh trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations are being generated. Danger zones occur in ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Frequency and size of these zones increase with ascending altitude. Small-to-mediuim sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. The risks of falling need consideration, esp. on hard, icy steep slopes, despite being blanketed by fresh snow. A cautious route selection is advised. Danger of glide-snow avalanches: on steep smooth slopes in all aspects below 2200 m, small-to-medium releases are possible, difficult to assess, possible at any time of day. Circumvent glide cracks.",
