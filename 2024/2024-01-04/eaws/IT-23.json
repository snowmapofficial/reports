        "comment": "Down to low altitudes snow will fall on Friday. The more recent wind slabs will be covered with new snow and therefore difficult to recognise. In particular in the northwest and at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions the avalanche prone locations are more widespread. <br/> <br/> Since Wednesday: The northwesterly wind has transported the fresh and old snow significantly. The sometimes deep wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant on steep north, east and south facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> Meticulous route selection is appropriate. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. <br/> On very steep slopes medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large dry avalanches are possible as a consequence of new snow and wind. <br/>",
