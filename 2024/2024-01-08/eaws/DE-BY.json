Fresh snowdrift accumulations are the main problem. Danger zones occur esp. in steep ridgeline terrain on S/W/N facing slopes and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Fresh snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as medium-sized slab avalanches even by minimal additional loading. The frequency of avalanche prone locations increases with ascending altitude.\r\nIn addition, isolated glide snow avalanches can be expected esp. on very steep slopes with a smooth ground beneath in all aspects - natural triggering is possible. Glide cracks are covered, thus, hard to spot. At higher altitudes these releases can reach medium size.",
