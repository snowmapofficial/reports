They can be released even by a single winter sport participant. <br/> The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep slopes and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack here. <br/> Defensive route selection is appropriate. <br/> On very steep slopes only isolated small and medium-sized natural avalanches are possible.",
