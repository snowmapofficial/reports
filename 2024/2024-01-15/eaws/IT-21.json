These can be released by a single winter sport participant in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. The wind slabs have formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Caution is to be exercised at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack. The avalanches can in isolated cases reach large size.",
