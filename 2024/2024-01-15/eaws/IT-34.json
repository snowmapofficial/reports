The avalanche prone locations are to be found especially on very steep slopes above approximately 2400 m. <br/> At high altitude the wind slabs are larger. <br/> Fresh wind slabs are easy for the trained eye to recognise but to be assessed with care and prudence. They can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases. <br/> Isolated whumpfing sounds can indicate the danger.",
