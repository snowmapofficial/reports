As a consequence of a sometimes strong wind from westerly directions, further wind slabs will form in particular in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The fresh wind slabs are lying on surface hoar in some places. These are mostly rather small but prone to triggering. <br/> <br/> Towards its base, the snowpack is largely stable. Snow depths vary greatly above the tree line, depending on the infuence of the wind. The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations."
