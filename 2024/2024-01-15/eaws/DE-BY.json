Snowdrifts are the main problem. Danger zones are numerous, occur in steep ridgeline terrain in NW/E/S facing terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls and forest clearances. Snowdrift accumulations can be triggered as slab avalanches even by 1 person. Avalanches can reach medium size. Caution towards dangers of long runout paths over hardened surfaces.\r\nIn addition, small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches can be expected in extremely steep terrain, released by persons or naturally, esp. in shady wind-protected terrain and forest edges. Don\u2019t overlook the risks of falling!",
