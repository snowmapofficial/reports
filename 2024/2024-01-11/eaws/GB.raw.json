        "WeatherInfluences": "It will remain dry and settled.  South-Westerly winds will increase through the day. The freezing level will not be well defined, with various inversion layers. However, it will remain generally at or below freezing at most levels.",
        "SnowStability": "Little change is expected in the snowpack, it will remain cold and generally stable throughout. A few instabilities will exist on very shallow and isolated patches of windslab which will exist on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres. However, these will be very limited in extent.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After an overnight frost it was a clear day with long spells of sunshine.  There was a temperature inversion with the summit temperatures rising above freezing, but shady locations at lower levels remaining below freezing.  The air was very dry. There was a breeze from the North-East.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The clear and dry conditions meant that the snowpack stayed below freezing in most locations despite the warm air temperatures. Stability remains generally good throughout. Some very localised and shallow areas of windslab exist, mainly on North-West to North-East aspects above 1000 metres.  However, these are easily avoidable.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",
