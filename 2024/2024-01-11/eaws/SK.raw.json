      "comment" : "The avalanche danger level 2 is declared above the forest zone. Due to the cold air and strong winds of the previous days, dangerous layers of square-grained snow are forming in the cover, or there are snowflakes in the cover. These types of snow are not interbedded with the other layers. On top of them there is a puffy snow slab of varying thickness and hardness, which creates instability. It is susceptible to the release of a small to medium avalanche with only a small additional load. Especially on steep slopes and in all orientations. Occasional spontaneous avalanches may occur on leeward steep slopes.",

Underneath, soft, square-grained snows have been formed and maintained by the cold air. There may be several such layers in the cover. Overnight snowfall, up to 5 cm of new snow, will be very unevenly distributed due to strong winds and storms and will aggravate the whole avalanche situation."
