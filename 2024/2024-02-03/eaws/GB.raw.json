        "SnowDistribution": "Icy paths and hillsides. Cloudy on the tops. Winds 30-40 mph, progress difficult and tiring.",
        "Comment": "There is uncertainty around forecast snow amounts. If snow showers don\\'t merge together then the snow quantities may be less and the avalanche hazard reduced. Runs outs will remain a serious hazard.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers above 900 metres, which may merge to give longer spells of precipitation. The freezing level will  hover around 900 metres. Gale force Westerly winds.",
        "SnowStability": "Fresh unstable windslab will develop on North-East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Steep wind sheltered locations such as gully tops and coire rims will be most affected. Cornices will start to build above the same locations. Elsewhere, the old snowpack will remain firm and stable. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
