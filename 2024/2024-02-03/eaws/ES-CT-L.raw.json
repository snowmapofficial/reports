      "comment" : "As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist snow slides being released will increase for a while in particular on very steep sunny slopes at intermediate and high altitudes. Extremely steep grassy slopes and steep terrain that is interspersed with rocks: A latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. The avalanches are rather small."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften earlier than the day before. <br/> Shady slopes: Towards its surface, the snowpack is faceted and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a resilient crust. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
