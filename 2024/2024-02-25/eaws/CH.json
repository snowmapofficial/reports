Southwesterly winds led to the formation of widespread wind slabs at the weekend, including large ones in the south. Some of these are still prone to triggering. With new snow in the south and strong southerly winds at altitude as well as southerly foehn winds in the north, wind slabs will continue to grow. New snow and wind slabs are overlaying a mostly compact old snowpack, and fractures deep in the snowpack are not generally expected in the north. In the south, however, there were naturally triggered avalanches on north-facing slopes at the weekend, sometimes also in deeper layers of the snowpack.</p><p>Individual gliding avalanches are still possible, primarily on east-, south- and west-facing slopes below approximately 2600 m and more rarely on north-facing slopes below approximately 2200 m.
