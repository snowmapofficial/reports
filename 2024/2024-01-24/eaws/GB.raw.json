        "Summary": "TOR for 25/1 The generally wet and thawing snowpack will remain stable in all locations and aspects. Av Haz Low",
        "SnowDistribution": "Diminishing snowpack, reasonable cover above 800 metres. Generally good visibility, but poor in showers.  Winds 20-30 mph progress difficult at times with stronger gusts.",
        "Comment": "Another freeze-thaw cycle expected at summit level. Further consolidation of the snowpack, but a generally diminishing trend, not helped by gales and rain tomorrow afternoon.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Largely dry overnight before rain arrives mid morning with a little sleet and snow possible above 900 metres initially. The fresh to strong Westerly wind will back Southerly overnight, strengthening to gale force for a time in the afternoon. The freezing level will hover around 950 metres before rising well above the summits by mid morning.",
        "SnowStability": "The generally wet and thawing snowpack will remain stable in all locations and aspects, becoming firmer overnight at summit level, before thawing again later. Any new snow on the highest summits will be insignificant and short lived. Remaining cornices will be small and generally well consolidated. Depleted snow cover overall and patchy below 700 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mild, windy and showery day. Showers of rain at all levels initially, becoming wintry with sleet on the highest summits later. West-North-West gales, easing through the afternoon. Freezing level at or slightly above the highest tops.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is wet, generally well consolidated and stable in all locations and aspects. It continues to thaw at all levels except for the highest summits. Most snow remains on high North-East to South-East aspects, such as coire backwalls and rims, summit ridge flanks and in gullies. Becoming patchy below 700 metres. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Wet snowpack, slowly re-freezing at the highest elevations.  Cloudy on the tops with some bright spells. Winds 30 -40 mph, progress difficult and tiring.",
        "Comment": "Another cycle of fluctuation temperatures, rain tomorrow afternoon will lead to some further snow loss. There still remains decent snow cover above 800 metres on North to East aspects.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Dry overnight, then rain at all levels from late morning onwards. South-East to South-Westerly winds will be fresh overnight, becoming very strong to gale force during the day.   Freezing levels will rise to well above the summits during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Overnight, the existing snowpack, will continue to slowly consolidate. During the day, there may be some wet instabilities on very steep North-East to South-East aspects above 950 metres.  Any remaining cornices will be prone to collapse.  Other aspects will be stable at all altitudes.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "There were occasional squally showers, these of snow and hail above 900 metres with rain below this. The freezing level was around 1000 metres, and the winds were Westerly, gale force.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack is generally stablising; however some weaknesses still persist above 900 metres, on very steep North-East to South-East aspects.  Firmer snow at summit levels.  Elsewhere the snowpack is generally stable.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "Comment": "Snowfall expected to turn to rain late morning.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Becoming cooler with the freezing level around 900 metres overnight, rising above all summits in the afternoon. Snow showers early morning but turning to rain as the freezing level rises. Strong winds, South-South-East or South during snowfall.",
        "SnowStability": "The majority of the snowpack will be generally well bonded. New accumulations will form, deepest accumulations are expected in wind sheltered locations on North to East aspects above 900 metres. Surface instabilities are possible on steep terrain such as gully exits and scarp slopes as snowfall turns to rain and freezing levels rise. Stability of remaining cornices will be poor. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The freezing levels were above the summits overnight but dropped to around the higher tops by midday. The heavy rain eased, dry during the day. Very windy, mainly West-North-West. Several gusts over 100 mph were recorded but started to ease late morning.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack is thawing but has generally consolidated in most locations. Isolated unstable areas persist above 1000 metres, particularly around steep gully exits and scarp slopes on North through East to South-East aspects. Stability of remaining cornices is suspect. There is little snow left below 900 metres.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will initially be 900 metres before rising to 2000 metres during the day.  A dry evening with small amounts of precipitation during the day, with snow being confined to highest summits before turning to rain at all levels.  Very strong Westerly winds will back to the South-South-East and increase to gale force during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing moist snowpack will continue to consolidate overnight. Where the deepest accumulations are present instabilities will persist on North-West through East to South-East aspects above 1000 metres.  Areas most affected will be gully tops, coire rims and other steep wind sheltered locations.  Cornices will remain a threat from sudden collapse on the same aspects especially during the day. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Storm force Westerly winds eased slightly during the day.  The freezing level remained around 1100 metres.  Showers in the morning, falling as sleet above 1000 meres before clearing to leave a dry afternoon.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "After a period of high instability the existing snowpack is now becoming moist throughout and continues to consolidate; however instabilities are still present in steep wind shelters locations on mainly North through East to South-East aspects above 950 metres.

Limited wet snow instability may persist on a few very steep North through East to South-East aspects above 1000m, some of which are overhung by weakening, collapse prone cornices.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedSnowStability": "A period of poor stability overnight with several avalanches and collapsing cornices. Overall snow stability improved during the course of the day though some limited wet snow instability remains on some very steep North to East aspects above 950m.
