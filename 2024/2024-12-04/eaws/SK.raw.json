      "comment" : "The avalanche danger is very local and concerns isolated places where snow is deposited in the form of smaller snow slabs and pillows. Such places are mainly on the leeward sides of ridges, peaks and terrain obstacles. The release of smaller avalanches or slides is possible only with a large additional load, and their danger lies mainly in pushing the affected person into exposed /rocky/ terrain.",

      "comment" : "During the last snowfall period, 5 to 25 cm of new snow fell in the high mountains of Slovakia.  The greater amount is naturally found above the forest belt and on the leeward slopes of various exposures. Smaller slabs and snow pillows can also be found here, which at higher altitudes lie on top of a layer of older, frozen snow. At lower and middle elevations, new snow is found on a grassy substrate. As a result of the inverse weather, the snow cover is mostly melted and, on the southern slopes, frozen, possibly with a crust on the surface. On the northern slopes and in shaded areas, the snow remains loose and dry at high altitudes."
