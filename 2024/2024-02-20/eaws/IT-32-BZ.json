The fresh wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> In very isolated cases dry avalanches can also be released in the old snowpack. This applies in particular on the Main Alpine Ridge and to the south. Avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in little used terrain above approximately 2400 m, especially on very steep shady slopes. <br/> <br/> On very steep grassy slopes only isolated gliding avalanches are possible below approximately 2400 m.",
