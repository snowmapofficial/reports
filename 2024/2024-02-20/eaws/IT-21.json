The wind was moderate to strong in the vicinity of peaks. <br/> The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released, especially by large additional loads, in particular on northwest to east to southeast facing aspects and generally at intermediate and high altitudes. They are to be found especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> At the base of rock walls and on very steep sunny slopes individual small to medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible in the afternoon. <br/> In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust.",
