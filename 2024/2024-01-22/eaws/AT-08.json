        "comment": "Fresh snowdrifts are trigger-prone at high altitudes. Size and frequency of danger zones increase with ascending altitude. Danger zones are covered, they occur in ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, increasingly occur also distant from ridges. Small-to-medium sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. Backcountry sports require much experience in assessing avalanche dangers on-site and prudent route selection; mind the risks of falling. Small loose-snow avalanches are possible in steep rocky terrain due to solar radiation. Despite lower temperatures, glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
