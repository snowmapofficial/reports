        "comment": "Avalanche danger above the treeline is moderate, danger is low beneath that altitude. Danger zones are the freshly generated snowdrift accumulations, near to and distant from ridgeline terrain, esp. on E/S facing slopes, at entries to gullies and bolws where a slab can be triggering even by 1 person. Windblown exposed surfaces are often hard and icy, acute danger of falling. Gliding snow activity is increasing on sunny slopes, even large glide-snow avalanches are possible where the snowfall has been heavy. Poor visibility makes assessing the avalanche danger difficult on individual slopes.",
