      "comment" : "The hard wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes. Mostly the avalanches are small and can mostly be released by large loads. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The snowpack will be generally subject to considerable local variations. Hard wind slabs are lying on soft layers in particular on shady slopes. The weather conditions will foster a stabilisation of the snow drift accumulations. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to slight softening of the snowpack in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2700 m. From a snow sport perspective, in most cases insufficient snow is lying."
