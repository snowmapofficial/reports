        "comment": "Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack. As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2400 m, also in gullies and bowls in particular above approximately 1500 m, as well as on steep sunny slopes. <br/> Until Saturday the wind will be strong at times over a wide area. The fresh wind slabs will form in the vicinity of peaks. The fresh wind slabs must be evaluated with care and prudence. Older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads,. The hard wind slabs are easy to recognise. Skiers can release avalanches only in isolated cases, including medium-sized ones. The avalanche prone locations are to be found also in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain.",
        "highlights": "Until Saturday the wind will be strong at times. Moist and wet avalanches and slab avalanches are the main danger."

        "comment": "The weather was mild. The spring-like weather conditions gave rise to moistening of the snowpack below approximately 2400 m. As a consequence of mild temperatures and solar radiation a crust formed on the surface during the last few days. Snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. The sometimes strong wind will transport only a little snow. Weak layers in the old snowpack necessitate caution and restraint."
