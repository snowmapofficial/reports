        "comment": "A mostly favourable avalanche situation will prevail. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface. <br/> As a consequence of a strong wind from northerly directions, small wind slabs will form in the course of the day at high altitude. Along the border with Switzerland the avalanche danger is a little higher. <br/> Avalanches can be released in near-surface layers in particular. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible, in particular in case of releases originating from very steep sunny starting zones below approximately 2800 m that still retain some snow.",
        "highlights": "The backcountry touring conditions are mostly favourable."

Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. Also adjacent to ridgelines hardly any snow is lying."
