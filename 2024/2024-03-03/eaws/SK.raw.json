On steep grassy slopes, the occurrence of gliding avalanches is still possible, which may affect valley routes. At the highest altitudes of the Tatra Mountains (approx. above 2000 m above sea level) and especially on the northern exposures there are locally formed snow slabs and pillows of new snow, which may pose a risk when loaded.",
