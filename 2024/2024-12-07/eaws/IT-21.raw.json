Mostly the avalanches in these loacations are medium-sized. <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls."

In some places new snow and wind slabs are lying on a hard crust. <br/> At higher altitudes snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions below approximately 2500 m only a little snow is now lying."
