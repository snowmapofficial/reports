Strong westerly to northwesterly winds are leading, especially in the north and at high altitudes, to the formation of wind slabs that are sometimes prone to triggering. In the north, some of these are large. Towards the south, the supply of snow that might drift is appreciably smaller. This also means that fresh wind slabs are smaller and avalanche-prone locations are less prevalent.</p><p>Before the onset of the wintry weather, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to approximately 2500 m. Falling temperatures have caused the old snowpack to stabilise. Wet and gliding avalanche activity has decreased appreciably. Gliding avalanches are still possible in very isolated cases.</p>"
