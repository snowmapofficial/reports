        "comment": "In the last two days mostly small wind slabs formed especially in places that are protected from the wind. As a consequence of new snow and strong wind they have increased in size on Thursday. These can to an increasing extent be released, even by small loads in isolated cases, but they will be small in most cases, especially on extremely steep slopes. These avalanche prone locations are easy to recognise. <br/> Even a small avalanche can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation dry and moist avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in isolated cases. This applies in particular on very steep sunny slopes.",
        "highlights": "The weather will be mostly sunny. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard crust. Fresh wind slabs represent the main danger."
