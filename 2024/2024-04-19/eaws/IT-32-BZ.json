In high Alpine regions these avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases, in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow more frequent mostly small loose snow avalanches are to be expected, especially in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> Only isolated medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible.
