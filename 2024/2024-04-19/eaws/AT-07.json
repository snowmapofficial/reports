The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls above approximately 2000 m.

Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",

As a consequence of new snow and wind, avalanche prone wind slabs will form in isolated cases. They are lying on soft layers above approximately 2000 m. <br/> <br/> The old snowpack is moist and its surface has a resilient melt-freeze crust. This applies on sunny slopes in all altitude zones, as well as on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m. <br/> Below approximately 1800 m only a little snow is lying."
