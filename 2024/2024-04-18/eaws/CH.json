From Friday morning to Saturday afternoon, another 30 to 50 cm of snow will fall on the Northern Alpine Ridge and in Pr\u00e4ttigau. South of the Main Alpine Ridge, it will remain largely dry and it will be partly sunny on both days. The wind will blow strongly from the west in the north on Friday and strongly from the northwest at high altitudes in all regions. On Saturday, the wind will shift to the north and blow strongly at high altitudes and in the south.</p><p><br></p><p>The danger of dry avalanches will temporarily decrease slightly on Friday. It will increase again on Saturday and naturally triggered avalanches are to be expected, some of them large. The conditions for snow sports outside marked and open pistes will be critical in the north. In central and southern Ticino, the avalanche danger will hardly change.</p><p>In regions with a lot of new snow, loose snow avalanches and moist snow slides are to be expected on Friday as a result of solar radiation in the early morning.</p>"
