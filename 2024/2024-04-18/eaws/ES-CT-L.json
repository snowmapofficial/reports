        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation only isolated small moist avalanches are possible. These can in some places be released by a single winter sport participant. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes at high altitude. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the hard snow surface.",
