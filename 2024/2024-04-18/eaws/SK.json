This will bring cloudy overcast weather with snow showers, which will be of a snowy nature from the middle altitudes (1200m). In the High Tatras there is a moderate avalanche danger above 2100 m above sea level. Due to strong winds and new snowfalls, the main avalanche problem is wind-blown snow. Especially the leeward sides of the highest ridges, narrow leeward couloirs on the S, SE, NE and E orientations are dangerous. In these places it is possible to find locally wind-blown slabs of different hardness, which are deposited on very hard ground. They can be loosened especially on steep slopes under high additional loads. Spontaneous avalanches are not expected.",

The surface of the snow cover is hard to icy in many places. During the last period of snowfall, up to 10 cm of new snow fell at the highest altitudes. However, this is very unevenly distributed due to strong winds. The windward sides of the mountains are hard and icy, with slabs of wind-blown snow on the leeward sides of the highest elevations (SE, SW, SE and E). Where snow has fallen without wind action there is loose powder snow. Most snow is found in northeast to east orientations. Continuous snow cover is found above 1600 m above sea level."
