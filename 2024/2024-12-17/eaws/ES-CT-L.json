        "comment": "As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation numerous small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist avalanches are to be expected. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Very steep grassy slopes: Gliding avalanches are likely to occur. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The more recent wind slabs of last week can be released by a single winter sport participant on shady slopes and generally at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The avalanches are rather small. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",

In particular at high altitude snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
