The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes in all altitude zones. <br/> <br/> Very steep grassy slopes: Gliding avalanches are likely to occur. Sometimes Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The more recent wind slabs of last week can be released by a single winter sport participant on shady slopes and generally at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The avalanches are rather small. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger."

      "comment" : "East, south and west facing slopes: The surface of the snowpack has frozen to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing moistening of the snowpack especially on very steep sunny slopes. <br/> Shady slopes: The upper section of the snowpack is dry. <br/> Above the tree line there are 50 to 80 cm of snow. In particular at high altitude snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind."
