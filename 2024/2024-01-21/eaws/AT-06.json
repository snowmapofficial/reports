The drifts generated on Friday are bonding with the old snowpack surface. Danger zone are indicated by wind signs, easy to recognize, occur mosetly in shady terrain, esp. near ridgelines and at entries into gullies a slab avalanche can be triggered by 1 person. Gliding snow actdivitdy is increasing, even large releases are possible where snowfall has been heavy. Isolated loose-snow avalanches will remain small. Windblown exposed surfaces are often hard and icy, acute danger of falling.",
