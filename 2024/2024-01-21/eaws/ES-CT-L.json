The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found on very steep grassy slopes and in steep rocky terrain. <br/> Southern border of Aran: Some fresh snow and the small wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in isolated cases on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m.",
