        "SnowDistribution": "New snow on higher slopes with drifting.  Poor visibility in the snow showers.  Winds 30 -40 mph becoming stronger later.",
        "Comment": "Storm Isha will affect the area bringing rain overnight and very strong winds, snow showers by morning and through the day will be frequent and heavy at times. It will remain windy. The older snowpack will start to re-freeze but accumulations of fresh windslab and cornices will be unstable.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "The freezing level will rise above the summits later on Sunday with rain affecting all levels overnight. It will become very windy. There will be a return to colder conditions by morning with the freezing level around 600 metres. Westerly gales with frequent and sometimes heavy snow showers will continue through Monday.",
        "SnowStability": "A period of higher instability will occur overnight as mild and wet conditions affect all levels. Colder conditions by morning will start to re-freeze the older snowpack. Fresh unstable windslab will form in wind sheltered locations. Gully exits and steep scarp slopes with a mainly Northerly to South-Easterly aspect above 850 metres will be particularly affected. Fragile cornices may form above these areas. Avalanches are likely. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "The freezing level rose above the summits overnight with some rain affecting all levels. Cooler conditions returned today with the freezing level around 850 metres. New snow is affecting slopes above 750 metres. Winds have been strong to gale force generally South to South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Areas of windslab are forming in wind sheltered locations mainly above 850 metres. Locations most affected are summit gullies and steep slopes with a generally North-West through North to Easterly aspect. Fragile cornices exist above these areas.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Wet thawing snowpack at lower levels, firmer with crust above 750 metres.  Cloudy on the tops most of the day.  Winds increased to approx 40 - 50 mph.",
        "Comment": "Very stormy weather tonight with Storm Isha, after a brief colder spell more mild and windy conditions to follow on Tuesday.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "A very wet and windy evening with the freezing level above the summits and rain at all levels. Rain will then ease and turn to showers which will fall as snow above 500 metres as the freezing level falls. Day time freezing level of around 600 metres. Storm force South-South-Westerly winds will become Westerly and decrease to Gale force through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "Initially wet snow instabilities may develop in steep terrain during the heavy rain in the early evening. The existing snowpack will then continue to consolidate in the drier conditions and falling temperatures and become well bonded and stable in all locations during the day time. Isolated shallow unstable windslab will develop during the day on steep North-East to South-East aspects above 800 metres. Deposits generally confined to gully tops and coire rims. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "A mainly dry day with the occasional shower which fell as snow above around 550 metres for most of the day. The freezing level was around 700 metres rising above the summits late afternoon. Very Strong mainly Southerly winds.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The existing snowpack is continuing to consolidate in the fluctuating temperatures and is stable in most locations. Isolated shallow windslab deposits are developing on North-West to North-East aspects above 800 metres, mainly around coire rims and gully tops. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "Comment": "A constantly changing snowpack with a thaw, freeze cycle and further snowfall over the next 24 hours.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Significant rain at all levels will turn to snowfall during the middle of the night.  This will continue as snowfall above 500 metres for the rest of the forecast period. Gale to storm force South to South-Westerly winds will veer to become Westerly.  The freezing level will fall from above the summits to 700 metres by day break.",
        "SnowStability": "Initially the snowpack will become increasingly unstable with avalanches likely on steep North-West through North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres.  Cornices will be unstable.  As it turns cooler the snowpack will begin to consolidate and new poorly bonded windslab and fragile cornices will develop on North through East to South-East aspects above 850m. On these aspects between 850m and 600m steep banks will be affected by more localised windslab.  The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Snow showers on gale force Southerly winds with significant drifting at higher levels.  The freezing level at midday was around 1000 metres.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "New accumulations of poorly bonded windslab have developed on North-West through North to Easterly aspects above 850 metres.  The greatest instability is above 900 metres in steep wind sheltered locations such as around coire rims, crag aprons and the tops of gullies.  On these aspects fragile cornices are developing. Elsewhere the old snowpack has developed a widespread breakable crust.  The avalanche hazard is Considerable.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Mild with heavy rain early in the night. Later in the night and through the day it will be colder with the freezing level around 800 metres. Showers will fall as snow above 600 metres. Very strong West-South-West winds slowly easing through the day.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be a period of wet snow instability early in the night. The colder temperatures later in the night will consolidate the existing snowpack. However, through the day areas of fresh windslab will start building up sheltered North through East to South-East aspects above 900 metres. Cornices will be prone to collapse.

        "SnowStability": "There will be a period of increased instability overnight as the rain and mild conditions take effect. Cornices will be prone to collapse. Worst affected locations will be North to East aspects above 900 metres. Stability will improve during the day as the wet snow slowly refreezes before fresh windslab starts to form over a firm base, in wind sheltered locations on mainly North through East to South-East aspects above 800 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Considerable.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Precipitation, falling as snow initially above 600 metres, turned to rain up to 850 metres during the morning, as the freezing level rose to around 900 metres by midday. Winds were strong, increasing to gale force, South-South-Westerly.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Thaw conditions had prevailed overnight with snow loss at lower elevations. During the morning, fresh windslab formed in wind sheltered locations on mainly North to East aspects above 900 metres but with some cross-loading onto North-West and South-East aspects.

Cornices will be prone to collapse during this time.
