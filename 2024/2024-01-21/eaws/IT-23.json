Such avalanche prone locations are to be found also in places that are some distance from ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain above approximately 2200 m, caution is to be exercised in particular along the border with France and along the border with Switzerland. <br/> <br/> Dry avalanches can be released in deep layers by large loads.
