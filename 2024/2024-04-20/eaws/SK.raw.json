The windward sides of the mountains are hard and icy, on the leeward sides of the highest altitudes (SE, SW, SE and NE) there are slabs of wind-blown snow. Where snow has fallen without wind action there is loose powder snow. Most snow is found in northeast to east orientations. Continuous snow cover is found above 1600 m above sea level."
