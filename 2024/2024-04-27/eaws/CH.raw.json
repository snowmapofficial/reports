The new snow is drifting significantly at high altitudes. In the north, strong to storm-force southerly winds are causing loose old snowpack to drift. Wind slabs are also forming here. The old snowpack is mostly well consolidated under the new and drift snow, although from mid-April onwards weak layers with a sometimes faceted crystal structure have formed at the transition to the old snowpack. This is particularly the case in inneralpine regions.</p><p>As temperatures rise, the layers of fresh snow from this week are becoming increasingly soaked in the north. Before the onset of the wintry weather this week, the old snowpack on east-, south- and west-facing slopes was soaked up to above 3000 m and on north-facing slopes up to around 2500 m.
