On steep grass-covered slopes in all aspects which have not yet discharged, glide-snow avalanches can release at any time of day or night, releases medium, even large-sized are possible in high-altitude starting zones where the snowpack is deep. Avoid zones below glide cracks. \r\nIn few danger zones (on shady slopes above 2400 m) isolated weak layers in the uppermost part of the snowpack can trigger by large additional loading, slab avalanches can grow to medium size, in isolated cases to large size. Caution urged in terrain with danger of falling.\r\nSmall fresh snowdrifts can be generated, but will be unlikely to trigger.",
