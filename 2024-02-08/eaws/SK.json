Dangerous places are located on leeward slopes, troughs and moguls, mostly with south to east orientation. Medium-sized avalanches can be released in such places, mainly after a large additional load. Caution is required in places where old packed snow alternates with wind-blown snow deposits in the form of slabs and pillows.  The zero isotherm will rise to 2000 m a.s.l. during the day. An influx of warm air will cause waterlogging and a reduction in snow stability, especially at middle altitudes (up to 1800 m a.s.l.). Minor avalanches and avalanches from wet snow are expected, possibly even medium-sized wet avalanches."
