Danger zones increase with ascending altitude.\r\nThe older snowdrift accumulations which were generated during the snowfall are mostly triggerable only by large additional loading (group of persons, breaking cornice) and can grow to large size.\r\nOver the last few days, large cornices have formed. Due to higher temperatures the risk of their breaking is heightened. Avoid zones below cornices.\r\nUp to 2500 m, glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally at any time of day, esp. on steep smooth slopes (grass-covered, rocks) in all aspects, medium-sized at 1400-2500 m.\r\nFurthermore, due to rain impact wet loose-snow avalanches are possible in extremely steep terrain, mostly small sized.",
