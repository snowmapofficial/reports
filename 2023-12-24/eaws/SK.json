        "comment": "For all our mountain ranges is declared the 3rd level of avalanche danger (increased danger) from the 5-point international scale.\n\nIn the Fatras and Tatras, 30 to 50 cm of new snow fell in the last period, which was unevenly distributed by strong winds. There are large and dangerous cushions of packed snow in troughs and moguls of predominantly easterly orientation. On very steep slopes there is a risk of avalanche release with only a small additional load.\nAt altitudes up to 2000m above sea level, beware of moving on very steep slopes, where avalanches from wet snow can also be released with a small additional load.\nIn the current warming period, the occurrence of spontaneous avalanches of medium size is also likely.",

The gradual warming and humidity is causing new snow to fall, which is losing its looseness and softness.\nSince Thursday, a period of almost continuous snowfall has been ongoing, during which 30 to 50 cm of new snow has been added to our mountain ranges. During the snowfall, strong winds have continued to blow, mainly from the north-west direction, transporting the loose snow into the forest belt, where we are recording up to 70cm of new snow in places.\nThe wind also piled up large amounts of snow on the leeward slopes. The thickness of the pillows here is more than 1m.\nThe snow is falling on old hard frozen ground, which is exposed at high altitudes in places, but elsewhere poses a risk of slippery surfaces for avalanches!"
