          <avActivityHighlights>The snowdrifts are prone to triggering. Glide-snow avalanches continue.</avActivityHighlights>
          <avActivityComment>Avalanche danger is moderate. Main problem: snowdrift accumulations. Danger zones occur on wind-loaded steep slopes near to and distant from ridges in all aspects, and at entries int gullies and bowls. The snowdrift accumulations are prone to triggering in places, large avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person. Older snowdrifts require large additional loading. A cautious route selection is advised. Caution also urged near cornices due to possible breakage. On steep smooth slopes in all aspects below 2400 m, medium-to-large sized glide-snow avalanches are possible. Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger. On sunny slopes, mostly small loose-snow avalanches can be expected if there is solar radiation.</avActivityComment>
          <snowpackStructureComment>Snow was irregularly distributed during the last few days due to storm-strength winds. Crests and ridges are utterly windblown, gullies and bowls and zones behind protruberances are filled to the brim with drifted snow. Older drifts are often hardened, many surfaced are wind-compacted. The drifts are bonding well with the snowpack beneath them. Fresher drifts have weak intermediate layers, sometimes with graupel, and are prone to triggering. The fresh snow has settled well. At intermediate altitudes the snowpack is often moist down to the ground. The weight-load of the fresh snow reinforces the process of gliding over smooth ground.</snowpackStructureComment>
          <wxSynopsisComment>Nocturnal hours: Light rainfall in the early part of the night above 2200 m as light snowfall, coming to an end by midnight. Thereafter the clouds will disperse. Monday daytime: A sunny and mild day, but still windy. Zero-degree level at 3000 m. At 2000 m: +2 to +6 degrees. Strong westerly winds.</wxSynopsisComment>
          <tendencyComment>The next few days will be sunny and mild. Danger of dry-snow slab avalanches will diminish. Danger of glide-snow avalanches will persist.</tendencyComment>
