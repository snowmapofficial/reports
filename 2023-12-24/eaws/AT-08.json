Danger zones occur on wind-loaded steep slopes near to and distant from ridges in all aspects, and at entries int gullies and bowls. The snowdrift accumulations are prone to triggering in places, large avalanches can be triggered even by 1 person. Older snowdrifts require large additional loading. A cautious route selection is advised. Caution also urged near cornices due to possible breakage. On steep smooth slopes in all aspects below 2400 m, medium-to-large sized glide-snow avalanches are possible. Glide cracks are indicators of potential danger.
