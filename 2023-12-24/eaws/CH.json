The new snow and snowdrift from the past week is becoming increasingly settled and compacted. Avalanche fractures are still possible within the newer snowdrift layers. On wind-protected slopes, new snow and snowdrift are lying on a loose, angular old snowpack surface. There, avalanches may also start at the transition to the old snowpack and may be extensive.</p><p>With the rain falling on Sunday evening up to around 2600 m and with the rise in temperature and incoming radiation during the day, moist snowslides from the new fallen snow and, increasingly, gliding avalanches are expected. In addition to the avalanche danger, you should also be aware of the risk of slipping on exposed steep terrain in the north when the surface of the snowpack is icy.</p>"

The new snow and snowdrift from the past week is becoming increasingly settled and compacted. Avalanche fractures are still possible within the newer snowdrift layers. On wind-protected slopes, new snow and snowdrift are lying on a loose, angular old snowpack surface. There, avalanches may also start at the transition to the old snowpack and may be extensive.</p><p>With the rain falling on Sunday evening up to around 2600 m and with the rise in temperature and incoming radiation during the day, moist snowslides from the new fallen snow and, increasingly, gliding avalanches are expected. In addition to the avalanche danger, you should also be aware of the risk of slipping on exposed steep terrain in the north when the surface of the snowpack is icy.</p>"
