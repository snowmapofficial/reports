On steep slopes below 2600m which have not yet discharged, medium-sized wet-snow avalanches can trigger naturally or be triggered by persons. Also isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible. In high-alpine zones, fresh snowdrift accumulations require attentiveness, most of them are small but often easily triggered. Danger zones occur in gullies, bowls, behind protruberances in the terrain and on steep shady slopes above 2600m. Isolated small-to-medium avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts in the old snow. Avalanche prone locations lie in seldom-tracked shady terrain and are difficult to recognize."

Through higher daytime temperatures and solar radiation, the crust then softens rapidly and the snowpack loses its firmness. Especially in the Silvretta region on high-altitude very steep shady slopes there are still unfavorable intermediate layers evident inside the old snowpack."
