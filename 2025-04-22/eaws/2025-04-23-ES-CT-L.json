        "comment": "Especially on steep sunny slopes more small and medium-sized moist snow slides and avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day. Avalanches can release the saturated snowpack and reach medium size. <br/> <br/> The older wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. They are to be found in particular on northwest, north and east facing slopes. At the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is slightly greater. In isolated cases the avalanches in these regions are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information about the snowpack, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
        "highlights": "Wet snow represents the main danger. Wind slabs in the high Alpine regions. Especially in the valleys bordering the Ribagor\u00e7ana basin and the Pallaresa basin the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent."
