The fresh snow can be triggered as a slab avalanche by a small additional load. Danger spots can be found in steep terrain of all exposures. At higher altitudes, avalanches can tear through to the deeper layers. Slab avalanches reach medium size. From extremely steep terrain, fresh snow can also release itself as a small or medium-sized loose snow avalanche.\n\nOn very steep, smooth meadow slopes and in gappy mountain forests, smaller sliding snow avalanches can also release themselves.",
