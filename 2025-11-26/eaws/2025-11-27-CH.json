The fresh and drifted snow has been deposited on a sometimes unfavourable old snow surface. In addition, deeper in the snowpack there are faceted weak layers that are prone to triggering, especially on shady slopes above approximately 2400 m and generally in the high Alpine regions. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation in the west, these layers have in some cases been thickly overlaid and in these places the snowpack is becoming increasingly stabilized. In regions which have seen less fresh snowfall, avalanches in these weak layers can still be triggered by human activity.</p><p>With northerly winds, Wednesday saw the formation of snowdrift accumulations which are prone to triggering, especially on the Main Alpine Ridge and in the south.</p>"
