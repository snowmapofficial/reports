Medium-sized slab avalanches can be triggered especially by large additional loading  at transitions from shall to deep snow. Avalanche prone locations occur primarily in very steep terrain in W/N/E aspects. Frequency and size increase with ascending altitude. In addition, on very steep slopes with smooth ground below 2000m isolated small glide-snow avalanches can trigger naturally in all aspects. Avoid stopping or staying below glide cracks.",
