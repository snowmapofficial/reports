Also naturally triggered avalanches and remote triggerings are possible. Whumpf noises and cracks when you tread upon the snowpack, as well as fresh avalanche releases, are alarm signals and indicate imminent danger. Naturally triggered glide-snow and loose-snow avalanches are possible, mostly small sized releases. Small-to-medium naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
