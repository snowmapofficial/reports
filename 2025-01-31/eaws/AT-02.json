Remote triggerings are possible, particularly treacherous are the foot of rock walls. A defensive route selection is important. In addition, on wind-loaded slopes, surface layers can be triggered in some places, the releases mostly small but easily triggered. In the major areas of precipitation, isolated and mostly small glide-snow avalanches are possible.",
