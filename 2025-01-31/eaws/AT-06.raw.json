In higher northwest to eastern sectors older mostly settled snowdrift areas existing. In places a old snow covers which is weakened due to equilibirum metamorphosis. This combination can be prone totriggering. Exposed areas are icy and hard. In steepp areas the wet snow cover is prone to glide when it is on smooth surfaces or grass."
