Avalanche triggerings are possible esp. inside the near-surface layers and in transitions to the old snow. Snowdrifts have often been blanketed, making them hard to recognize. On sunny slopes the most recent fresh fallen snow is already bonded. The old snowpack beneath it is well consolidated. At lower altitudes the fresh snow often fell on bare ground."
