Even single persons can release avalanches in some places, in particular at transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack, when entering gullies and bowls for example in particular at intermediate and high altitudes, and on very steep slopes above approximately 2200 m. Such avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on wind-loaded slopes. <br/> Little snow will fall in the late morning. These avalanche prone locations are covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> In very isolated cases the avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach large size.
