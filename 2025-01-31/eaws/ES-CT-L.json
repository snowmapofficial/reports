        "comment": "As a consequence of new snow and a moderate to strong northwesterly wind, extensive wind slabs formed in all aspects. This snow and in particular the sometimes deep wind slabs can be released by a single winter sport participant above the tree line. In isolated cases the avalanches are medium-sized. The avalanche prone locations are to be found adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Especially from the border with Benasque to the border with Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars these avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. <br/> Field observations and whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate a precarious avalanche situation on very steep slopes. <br/> <br/> Experience and restraint are required.",
        "highlights": "New snow and wind slabs are to be assessed with care and prudence."

The northwesterly wind will transport the new snow. <br/> The upper section of the snowpack is dry and has a loosely bonded surface. <br/> <br/> Also adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects: Even in moderately steep terrain there is a danger of falling on the icy crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
