Isolated danger zones occur also on sunny slopes which are little skied on in high alpine terrain, in isolated cases releases can grow to large size. Remote triggerings are possible, particularly treacherous are the foot of rock walls. A defensive route selection is important. In addition, on wind-loaded slopes, surface layers can be triggered in some places, the releases mostly small but easily triggered. In the major areas of precipitation, isolated and mostly small glide-snow avalanches are possible."
