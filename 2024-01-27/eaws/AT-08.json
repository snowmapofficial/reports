Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, behind discontinuities and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls. Small-to-medium sized avalanches can be triggered by one person. Backcountry sports require prudent route selection; mind the risks of falling. The situation is more critical at high altitudes, loose-snow avalanches are possible esp. in steep sunny and rocky tererain. Glide-snow avalanches are still a threat on steep grass-covered and rocky slopes in all aspects, avoid zones below glide cracks.",
