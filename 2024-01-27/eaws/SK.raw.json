      "comment" : "In the Western, High, western part of the Low Tatras and Mala Fatra there is an increased avalanche danger above the forest border, i.e. the 3rd degree. The main avalanche problem remains wind-blown snow. In recent days, it has transported large amounts of snow to the leeward sides of ridges, places under glass walls and narrow couloirs. Especially dangerous are the exposures of S, SE, SW and E orientations. Especially in these places there are hard wind-beaten slabs in which stresses propagate very well.  Loosening of these is already possible with a small additional load, especially on steep slopes. Avalanches from new snow deposited on top of the hard layer from the previous days are also threatening. In some cases, medium avalanches are threatened, exceptionally large spontaneous avalanches. Mountain terrain is not recommended for inexperienced hikers/ski mountaineers.",
      "highlights" : "Watch out for wind-wound slabs. There is also a risk of spontaneous large avalanches from new snow."
