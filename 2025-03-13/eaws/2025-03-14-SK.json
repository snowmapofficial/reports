Above 1800m above sea level, snowfall is expected, which may locally amount to more than 20cm. The new snow will be transported by the wind to the leeward slopes of mainly northern orientations and will form unstable snow slabs and pillows which may not be cohesive with the ground.",

The snow cover has hardened as a result of the rain and subsequent cooling. On the other hand, the snowfall limit should reach 1800 m above sea level, where unstable snow formations will form due to the wind. More snow is to be expected under rock walls, thresholds and in leeward areas."
