        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground. Winds approx 10 - 20 mph fresh, cooling. Good visibility.",
        "Comment": "The hills will look wintry with fresh snow overnight but this will be mostly superficial.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Overnight, showers falling as snow above 500 metres, dry thereafter. Fresh, North-West winds initially, veering North-Easterly through the night and decreasing to become light by the end of the forecasting period. The freezing level will drop to around 500 metres overnight and then rise steadily to 800 metres during the day.",
        "SnowStability": "There will be fresh snow above 500 metres although quantities are not expected to be significant. The old patchy snowpack will be firm and stable in all locations and will be mostly confined to steep North to East aspects above 950 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Deep snow on the plateau. Knee deep in isolated drifts. Whiteout conditions presenting some good navigation practice. Winds generally around 20mph.",
        "Comment": "A period of snow showers overnight are expected to result in rapid windslab accumulation in isolated locations.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Snow showers are expected thought much of the period above 600 metres, with some reaching lower levels. Winds will be North-Westerly strong overnight, veering to the North-North-East and increasing to very strong for a time. The freezing level will be around 600 to 700 metres.",
        "SnowStability": "Isolated unstable windslab will develop on South-East to South-West aspects above 900 metres, during a period of snowfall and drifting overnight. Accumulations will initially exhibit weaknesses in steep wind sheltered locations, such as coire rims and gully tops, although these weaknesses are expected to diminish later. Elsewhere a fresh dusting of snow will be present from around 400 metres upwards in the morning. Small cornices will also develop. The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight showers continued into the afternoon, falling as snow above 500 metres, later 800 metres. Winds were generally from the North-North-West and moderate in strength. The freezing level was around 650 metres at midday.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "The snowpack was observed to be generally stable with the greatest snow cover above 700 metres. Deeper accumulations of snow are present on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres due to snow drift. A fresh dusting of snow was present from around 400 metres upwards in the morning, which was subject to thaw later, particularly on slopes exposed to the sun. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

The vast majority of terrain will have insignificant, shallow cover.  The avalanche hazard will be Moderate.",
