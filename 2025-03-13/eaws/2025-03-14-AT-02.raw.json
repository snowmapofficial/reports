      "comment" : "Naturally triggered avalanche acdtivity will increase as intensive snowfall sets in. Avalanches can be triggered in the old snow and on shady slopes, then grow to large size. In addition, avalanches can be triggered by one sole skier in the near-surface layers. I isolated cases, avalanches can also fracture the wet snowpack and sweep it along. Caution urged at the foot of rock walls and behind protruberances in the landscape, as well as in gullies and bowls. Activity of small-to-medium loose-snow avalanches will increase significantly during the course of the day. The runout zones should be circumvented. On extremely steep grass-covered slopes, isolated glide-snow avalanches are possible during the afternoon hours, also medium-sized releases. The current situation makes extreme caution imperative.\nDue to fresh snow, likelihood of slab avalanches above 1800m. Avalanches can trigger in gullies, bowls, behind protruberances in the terrain in the near-surface layers, even by one sole skier. Also isolated naturally triggered avalanches are possible, more so if the precipitation intensifies, esp. at the foot of rock walls. Avalanches can trigger in the old snowpack and grow to medium size. Whumpf noises and naturally triggered releases are alarm signals, indicators of imminent danger. Below 1800m: naturally triggered wet-snow avalanche activity will increase with the beginning of rainfall. In starting zones which have not yet discharged, small-to-medium wet loose-snow avalanches are possible. The runout zones should be circumvented, esp. on extremely steep slopes below 1800m in all aspects."
