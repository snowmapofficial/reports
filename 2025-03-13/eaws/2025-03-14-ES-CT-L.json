        "comment": "The new snow and wind slabs of the last few days can be released easily, or, in isolated cases naturally in particular on steep shady slopes above approximately 2200 m. Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the snowpack in particular on steep shady slopes. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack and fresh avalanches are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack. These avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are barely recognisable because of the poor visibility. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the precipitation dry avalanches are possible as the day progresses, but they can reach medium size in some cases. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in steep terrain at intermediate and high altitudes and in places that are protected from the wind.",
