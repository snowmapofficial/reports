Avalanches can be released in deeper layers also."

Sunshine and high temperatures gave rise to moistening of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes below approximately 2900 m. As a consequence of highly fluctuating temperatures a crust formed on the surface during the last few days, this also applies on shady slopes below approximately 2000 m. <br/> In particular at intermediate altitudes less snow than usual is lying.
