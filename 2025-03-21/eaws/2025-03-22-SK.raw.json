During the day, small to medium-sized spontaneous avalanches from wet snow may occur on steep, sunlit slopes. On north (shaded) slopes, in couloirs, under saddles and rock walls, there are hard snow slabs and pillows that are not sufficiently bonded to the ground. Avalanche release in these areas is possible, especially with high additional loads.",

In leeward places it reaches up to 30 cm in places, elsewhere it is completely absent and the surface is made up of older frozen snow. As a result of the warming temperatures and sunlight, a crust is beginning to form on the southern slopes and, conversely, during the day the snow is turning damp to wet.  On the northern slopes, the snow remains dry, often deposited as hard slabs and pillows. Locally, loose powder snow still occurs. There is only patchy snow cover at altitudes up to 1400 m above sea level."
