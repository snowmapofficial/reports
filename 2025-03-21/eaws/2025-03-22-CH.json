On the northern flank of the Alps, the snowpack structure is otherwise quite favourable. In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are weak layers prone to triggering in the central part of the snowpack. Especially along the central and eastern parts of the Main Alpine Ridge and south of it, avalanches can also be triggered on shady slopes in near-ground layers of the snowpack.</p><p>On steep south-facing slopes, the snowpack is soaked up to the high Alpine regions, and on west-facing slopes below 2000 m. On east-facing slopes, the soaking is not yet so advanced and the snowpack is still mostly dry on north-facing slopes. Outgoing longwave radiation during the night is reduced by clouds and Saharan dust in the air. Only a thin melt-freeze crust forms, which softens rapidly in the late morning as a consequence of solar radiation.</p>"
