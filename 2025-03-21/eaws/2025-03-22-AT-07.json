Such avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found on very steep shady slopes at elevated altitudes, in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as at the base of rock walls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. In regions exposed to the foehn wind these avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day, the likelihood of wet loose snow avalanches being released will increase. On very steep slopes individual mostly small wet loose snow avalanches are possible from late morning. An increasing number of small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible as the penetration by moisture increases.",

The somewhat older wind slabs have bonded well with the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: <br/> As a consequence of mild temperatures and partly cloudy skies no crust will develop on the surface during the course of the night. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise as the day progresses to increasing softening of the snowpack. Below the tree line only a little snow is now lying."
