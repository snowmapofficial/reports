      "comment" : "Near-surface weak layers are still prone to triggering, esp. on seldom-tracked shady steep slopes. One sole skier can trigger a small-to-medium loose-snow or slab avalanche. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution. On steep grass-covered slopes with sufficient snow on the ground or atop smooth ground, isolated small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible. In rocky terrain, increasingly frequent slides and small loose-snow avalanches are possible."

      "comment" : "High-altitude shady slopes have small snowdrifts atop often faceted weak soft layers, bonding is often inadequate. At night a breakable crust forms, sometimes capable of bearing loads. On steep north-facing slopes, there is still powder. The old snowpack is well consolidated. On sunny slopes and at lower altitudes the fresh snow will fall on bare ground, the snow is often moist. Below 1500m there is little snow on the ground."

In addition, on steep grass-covered slopes where the snow is sufficient or over smooth ground, the danger of small glide-snow avalanches exists. Further, isolated danger zones occur esp. on steep shady ridgeline slopes. Small slab avalanches can be triggered by winter sports enthusiasts in isolated cases. Apart from the danger of being buried in snow masses, the risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall require adequate caution."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "On steep shady slopes at high altitudes, the latest fresh fallen snow often lies deposited atop soft layers, bonding usually good. Mild nocturnal temperatures, reduced outgoing longwave radiation, only a breakable crust can form. On steep high-altitude north-facing slopes the snow is often still powdery. The generally shallow old snowpack is mostly well consolidated. On sunny slopes the uppermost layers moisten during the daytime, lower altitude slopes are becoming bare of snow. Below 1500m there is little snow on the ground."
