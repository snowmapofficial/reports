However, wet snow instabilities will be present on steep terrain such as gully tops and coire headwalls, particularly on South-East to South-West aspects above 1000 metres, most notably in the remote coires to the North of the area. Remaining cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse. Elsewhere, the patchy snow cover will continue to thaw at all levels. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
