Danger zones near ridges, at entries into gullies and bowls, behind discontinuities. Instable snowdrifts have accumulated in exposed zones, triggerable as small-to-medium slab avalanches even by minimum additional loading. Freshly generated cornices are instable, easily triggered.  On shady steep high-altitude slopes, also large avalanches can be triggered (start of a persistent weak layer problem). Windblown surfaces are often icy and hard, acute danger of falling.",
