Moderate winds, North-West overnight, backing to the West-South-West by lunchtime, veering back to the North-West by the end of the day.\nObserved Weather Influences: Snowfall overnight to all levels, easing early morning to become a dry bright day. Very cold in the strong Northerly winds.\nObservedSnowStability: Moderately bonded windslab continues to develop in wind sheltered locations mainly on East through South to West aspects above 800 metres. Deepest accumulations are to be found in wind sheltered terrain such as steep gully exits and around corrie rims. Older snow is very firm and often icy. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
