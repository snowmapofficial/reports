The fresh and somewhat older wind slabs can be released easily. or in isolated cases naturally, in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. Sometimes avalanches are medium-sized. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow dry snow slides and avalanches are possible, but they will be mostly small. <br/> Dry avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases. <br/> All aspects: Gliding avalanches can be released at any time of day or night. In isolated cases Explanation: \"these\" may only stand for \"these avalanches\" are medium-sized. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
