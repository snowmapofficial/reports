      "comment" : "The weather in the Eastern Alps will be characterised by weak gradients. During the night to Friday and in the morning hours, dense clouds will persist in the Lower Austrian mountains up to altitudes of around 1500 metres. During the day, it may clear up again and again, with sunshine appearing in places alongside passing clouds. There will be no precipitation. Temperatures at 2000 m will be around -5 degrees, at 1000 m between -2 and +1 degrees. The north-westerly wind, which will be even stronger in exposed areas, especially in the eastern regions, will weaken everywhere during the daytime changes."

      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is low. In a few places, pillows of wind drifted snow can be triggered as small slab avalanches, especially in extremely steep and shady gullies and bowls. Avalanche prone locations as well as icy areas are often covered by some new fallen snow. Beware of persistent danger of falling!"

      "comment" : "There is still significantly less snow than average. Small, older pillows of wind drifted snow lie on a thin, crusted can form old snowpack, especially in the north and east sectors in shady terrain. The connection between wind slab and persistent weak layer is still poor in places. In addition, angular shapes can weaken the snow base, fundament."
