The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on west to north to east facing aspects above approximately 2200 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, as well as adjacent to ridgelines. The avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered with new snow and are therefore barely recognisable. Mostly the avalanches are small. <br/> <br/> Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.",
