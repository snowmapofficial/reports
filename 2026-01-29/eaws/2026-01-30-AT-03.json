During the night to Friday and in the morning hours, dense clouds will persist in the Lower Austrian mountains up to altitudes of around 1500 metres. During the day, it may clear up again and again, with sunshine appearing in places alongside passing clouds. There will be no precipitation. Temperatures at 2000 m will be around -5 degrees, at 1000 m between -2 and +1 degrees. The north-westerly wind, which will be even stronger in exposed areas, especially in the eastern regions, will weaken everywhere during the daytime changes."
