In particular on steep west, north and east facing slopes avalanches can be triggered in the weakly bonded old snow and reach medium size. <br/> Caution is to be exercised in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain, as well as in places that are protected from the wind. The number and size of avalanche prone locations will increase with altitude. <br/> <br/> Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm indicating the danger.
