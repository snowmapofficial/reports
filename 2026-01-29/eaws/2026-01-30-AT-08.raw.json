Danger zones occur in steep ridgeline terrain, in wind-loaded gullies and bowls, and behind drops in the terrain. Triggered releases can sweep away more deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack and grow to medium size. Such danger zones are not visible, particularly on steep shady slopes. Activities in backcountry demand careful evaluation of the terrain and the avalanche dangers, as well as restraint. On sunny slopes, small loosely-packed slides can trigger naturally during the course of the day."

      "comment" : "Small fresh and older snowdrifts in steep ridgeline terrain and behind drops in the landscape are prone to triggering. One single winter sports enthusiast can trigger small, in isolated cases medium-sized slab avalanches. Other danger zones occur on extremely steep, mostly shady slopes. In isolated cases there, small avalanches can be triggered in the old snow. These avalanche prone locations occur most often in transitions from shallow to deep snow, for example, at entry points into gullies and bowls. Apart from the risks of being buried in snow masses, the dangers of being swept along and forced to take a fall also require caution. On sunny slopes, small-sized loosely-packed snowslides can trigger naturally during the course of the day."

In some places, surface hoar has been blanketed. Particularly on shady steep slopes, unfavorable intermediate layers have often persisted. On south-facing slopes and at lower altitudes, the fresh snowfall often was deposited on bare ground."
