Above around 2000 m, slab avalanches can be triggered in some places by individual winter sports enthusiasts and can be of medium size. The number and size of avalanche prone locations generally increase rapidly above the tree line. Transitions from little to more snow should be consistently avoided. Caution should also be exercised in the snow-covered entrance areas to steep gullies and bowls as well as behind terrain edges, where prone-to-triggering snow packs are located. Some of these are covered in snow and therefore difficult to recognise! Avalanches that are triggered close to the surface can tear through to deeper weak layers. Whumpfing collapsing sounds when stepping on the snowpack can indicate danger.\n\nOn sunny slopes, small loose snow slides can detach spontaneously during daytime changes."

The older snowdrift accumulations and the old snow surface are in places transformed and soft, in places hard as a board.
