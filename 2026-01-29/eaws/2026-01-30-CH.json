These can also be triggered in deep layers and reach dangerously large size. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",

In these regions, avalanches can still be triggered very easily in the old snowpack in many areas, including remotely. Avalanches are also to be expected deeper in the snowpack in the inneralpine regions of Valais and Grisons, especially on northern and eastern slopes. The avalanche situation requires patience.</p><p>North of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine, snowdrift accumulations, some of which are prone to triggering, have formed in recent days, and these are now covered with fresh snow. On Friday, the westerly winds will result in mostly small snowdrift accumulations. Weak layers deeper in the snowpack are less prone to triggering in these regions and such hazardous zones are rarer than in other regions.</p>"
