Freezing at 600m.\nObserved Weather Influences: A trace of overnight snowfall and a few snow showers during the day. Cold summit temperatures throughout. Moderate later strong South-East winds.\nObservedSnowStability: Good stability in all wind exposed locations where hard or crusty conditions prevail. Older deep windslab is consolidating on most lee slopes at all altitudes. Drifting throughout the period gave rise to new weak windslab development on steep, sheltered West to North aspects above 950m. Less well bonded snow was localised here at the time of reporting. Some minor cornice development noted high above steeper lee slopes.  The avalanche hazard is Moderate."

Generally dry in the coastal ranges but light precipitation falling as snow showers above 600m on the inland mountains such as the Fannichs.\nObservedSnowStability: There is a thin cover of new snow on most aspects above 700m with some shallow but avoidable, stable accumulations in wind sheltered places on West through North to North-Easterly aspects  above 900m or so, these tend to be mainly inland from the coastal mountains.
