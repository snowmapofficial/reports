In some places, small slab avalanches can be triggered by even a small additional load in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The number of avalanche prone locations increases with altitude.\n\nPersistent weak layers can also be problematic above 1400 metres. In a few places, small to medium slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loads in deeper layers. These avalanche prone locations are mainly found on shady slopes. Caution is advised here in transition areas from little to much snow."

      "comment" : "On a small scale, windslab snow lies partly on soft snow at high altitudes, otherwise on variously crusted can form snow surfaces. A weak layer of angular snow crystals has formed underneath these layers of harsh snow. In the middle layers, this layer slowly stabilises with mild temperatures and a lack of outgoing longwave radiation. The base of the snowpack often consists of gritty floating snow. There is little to no snow on the south side."
