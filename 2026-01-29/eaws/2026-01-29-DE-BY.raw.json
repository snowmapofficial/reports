      "comment" : "The avalanche risk is moderate above the tree line and low below it. The main problem is wind slab. In steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines as well as in gullies and bowls, slab avalanches can occasionally be triggered by even small additional loads. Slab avalanches can reach medium size.\n\nPersistent weak layers can also be problematic above 1400 metres. In a few places, medium slab avalanches can be triggered in deeper layers by large additional loads. These avalanche prone locations are mainly found on shady slopes at the transition from little to much snow."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "On a small scale, windslab snow lies partly on soft snow at high altitudes, otherwise on variously crusted can form snow surfaces. A weak layer of angular snow crystals has formed underneath these layers of harsh snow. In the middle layers, this layer slowly stabilises with mild temperatures and a lack of outgoing longwave radiation. The base of the snowpack often consists of gritty floating snow. There is little to no snow on the south side."
