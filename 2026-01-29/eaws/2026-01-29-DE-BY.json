        "comment": "The avalanche risk is moderate above the tree line and low below it. The main problem is wind slab. In steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines as well as in gullies and bowls, slab avalanches can occasionally be triggered by even small additional loads. Slab avalanches can reach medium size.\n\nPersistent weak layers can also be problematic above 1400 metres. In a few places, medium slab avalanches can be triggered in deeper layers by large additional loads. These avalanche prone locations are mainly found on shady slopes at the transition from little to much snow.",
