        "comment": "The avalanche risk is moderate above the tree line and low below it. The main problem is wind slab. In some places, small slab avalanches can be triggered by even a small additional load in steep terrain adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects as well as in gullies and bowls. The number of avalanche prone locations increases with altitude.\n\nPersistent weak layers can also be problematic above 1400 metres. In a few places, small to medium slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loads in deeper layers. These avalanche prone locations are mainly found on shady slopes. Caution is advised here in transition areas from little to much snow.",
