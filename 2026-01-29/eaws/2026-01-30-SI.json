Places with blown snow and shady areas where there is a weak layer deep in the snowpack are more dangerous. In particular, at low loads, medium-sized avalanches of packed snow will be possible. A major Avalanche cannot be ruled out. Below 1700 m, gliding avalanches will be possible, especially on steep grassy slopes.",
