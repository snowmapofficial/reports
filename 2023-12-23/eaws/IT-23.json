As a consequence of a strong to storm force wind, sometimes deep wind slabs formed in the last few days in gullies and bowls and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. <br/> In particular at a distance from ridgelines places that are protected from the wind: More recent wind slabs are easy to recognise but can in some cases be released easily. Caution is to be exercised on steep slopes in particular between approximately 2300 and 2800 m. At transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack the likelihood of avalanches being released is greater. <br/> The weather will be mild. Small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible. This applies in particular in steep rocky terrain, and at the base of rock walls. <br/>",
