        "comment": "As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be only a slight increase in the danger of moist snow slides. Extremely steep grassy slopes and steep terrain that is interspersed with rocks: In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches exists. The avalanches are rather small.",
        "highlights": "The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable. Gliding avalanches and moist snow slides during the day are possible now only in isolated cases."

        "comment": "Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. <br/> Shady slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface has a resilient crust. In steep terrain there is a danger of falling here. High Alpine regions: The upper section of the snowpack is dry and has faceted crystals on the surface. <br/> Above approximately 2000 m there are 40 to 50 cm of snow. At low altitude from a snow sport perspective, insufficient snow is lying."
