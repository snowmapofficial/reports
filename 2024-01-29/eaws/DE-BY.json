On very steep slopes with smooth ground and grass-covered terrain and forest clearances, naturally triggered glide-snow avalanches are possible at any time of day or night. On the Allg\u00e4u Main Ridge, glide-snow avalanches can grow to large size, elsewhere maximum medium size. Avoid zones beneath glide cracks.\r\nSmall-to-medium sized slab avalanches can be triggered by large additional loading. The few danger zones occur in transition from shallow to deep snow, e.g. at entries into steep gullies.\r\nDue to solar radiation and mild temperatures, in addition, wet loose-snow avalanches trigger naturally as the day unfolds in steep rocky terrain.",
