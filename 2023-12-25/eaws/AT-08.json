The drifts are bonding well with the snowpack beneath them. Fresher drifts have weak intermediate layers, sometimes with graupel, and are prone to triggering. The fresh snow has settled well. At intermediate altitudes the snowpack is often moist down to the ground. The weight-load of the fresh snow reinforces the process of gliding over smooth ground."
