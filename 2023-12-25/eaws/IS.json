The profile shows a weak layer at 63 cm depth with faceted crystals, that are rounding, between an older softer layer and a layer of layered ice lenses. On top there are layered windslabs. Compression test gave a sudden planar break under medium stress (CT13, CT12 @63 SP) at the upper layerboundary of the faceted layer. This weakness may be widespread."
