In the Silvretta region, more deeply embedded layers inside the snowpack in rarely-skied terrain on steep shady slopes can in isolated cases be triggered by large additional loading. As temperatures rise and solar radiation makes itself felt, slides and small wet-snow avalanches and also more frequent small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches are possible.
