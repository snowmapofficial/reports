Caution in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, e.g. at entry points into gullies and bowls. These danger zones occur seldom. Avalanche releases tend to be small-sized. The risks of being swept along and forced to take a fall outweigh those of being buried in snow masses. On very steep sunny slopes, daytime warming and solar radiation make isolated small wet loose snow slides possible."

Highly varied snow depths, depending on wind impact. There is too little snow on the ground for this juncture of the season."
