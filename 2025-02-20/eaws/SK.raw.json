Avalanche release is possible only exceptionally in positions above the forest zone - on very steep slopes on which new snow is deposited. This locally forms snow slabs and pillows.",

      "comment" : "During the last period of light snowfall (16 Feb) up to 10 cm of new powder snow fell. This was subsequently transported to the leeward slopes, under saddles and rock faces at high altitudes. In these places, the height of the new snow is 10 to 20 cm, but this is a local matter. The new snow has not significantly changed the snow conditions or the avalanche situation. The snow cover is well below average for the time of year. Continuous snow cover (together with older snow) is found only at the highest altitudes of the mountains (above approximately 1500 m). On the surface there is up to 8 cm of new snow on average, under which is mostly frozen firn, on the northern slopes crust. In the valleys, paths and roads are often made of ice covered with newer snow."
