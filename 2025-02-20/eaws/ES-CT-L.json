        "comment": "As a consequence of the occasionally strong southerly wind, fresh snow drift accumulations will form in the course of the day. The fresh and older wind slabs can be released in isolated cases, but mostly only by large additional loads, in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2300 m. The avalanches are rather small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found at transitions into gullies and bowls and adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized wet and gliding avalanches are possible in all altitude zones.",
        "highlights": "Weakly bonded old snow at high altitude. The avalanche conditions are mostly favourable."

Isolated avalanche prone weak layers exist in the snowpack. In some cases the wind slabs have bonded still only poorly with each other and the old snowpack. <br/> <br/> Sunny slopes: The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise from the middle of the day to increasing moistening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. <br/> <br/> Especially on sunny slopes at low and intermediate altitudes hardly any snow is lying. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
