The mostly shallow wind slabs of the last few days have bonded well with the old snowpack. They are unlikely to be released now. <br/> <br/> Steep sunny slopes: The snowpack is well consolidated and its surface has a crust that is barely capable of bearing a load. The solar radiation will give rise as the day progresses to significant softening of the snowpack on steep sunny slopes. This applies at low and intermediate altitudes in all aspects. <br/> <br/> Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
