Danger zones are mostly small, occur in all aspects, hard to recognize even for the practiced eye. Fresh and older drifts on some NW/SE facing ridgeline slopes can be easily triggered as a small slab by minimum additional loading, these are easy to recognize, releases remain small-sized. On extemely steep slopes small loose-snow avalanches are possible. Isolated small glide-snow avalanches are possible."

      "comment" : "Atop a hardened crust and on high-altitude shady slopes in wind-protected terrain, there is still loose snow atop round crystals. In some places, winds from varying directions have transported the snow and blanketed layers of loose fresh snow on shady slopes or older surface hoar which is prone to triggering. On steep shady slopes the old snowpack fundament is expansively metamorphose (faceted crystals) and can in isolated cases be triggered. On sunny slopes up to 2400m there is no longer an area-wide cohesive snowpack fundament. In addition, on sunny slopes faceted layers near surface-near crusts have been generated. Where a slab has formed atop this, it is prone to triggering. On East/West/South facing slopes the snowpack in early morning bears a thin melt-freeze crust."
