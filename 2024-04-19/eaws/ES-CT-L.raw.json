      "comment" : "In general, the surface of the snow cover is brown due to the effect of the Saharan dust. The surface of the snowpack has frozen to form a strong crust and will already soften in the late morning. On shady slopes above approximately 2000 m there are 10 to 50 cm of snow, and even more in some localities. On steep sunny slopes only a little snow is lying."
