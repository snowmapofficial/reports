In high Alpine regions these avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. Avalanches can reach medium size in isolated cases, in particular in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of the new snow more frequent mostly small loose snow avalanches are to be expected, especially in the regions exposed to heavier precipitation. <br/> <br/> Only isolated medium-sized gliding avalanches are possible. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided."

In particular in the northwest up to 15 cm of snow, and up to 25 cm in some localities, will fall. As a consequence of new snow and a strong wind, avalanche prone wind slabs will form in some cases. They are lying on soft layers at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> The old snowpack is moist and its surface consists of loosely bonded snow lying on a strong melt-freeze crust. This applies on sunny slopes in all altitude zones, as well as on shady slopes below approximately 2600 m."
