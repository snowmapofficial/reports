        "comment": "Fresh wind slabs require caution. Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls, especially at high altitude. Even a small avalanche can sweep winter sport participants along and give rise to falls. <br/> Only isolated gliding avalanches are possible. This applies in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2200 m. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided.",
        "highlights": "Conditions are favorable concerning avalanche hazard. There is a danger of falling on the hard crust."
