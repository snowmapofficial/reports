The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas above approximately 2000 m and at transitions into gullies and bowls. <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation small moist loose snow slides are possible in all altitude zones."

      "comment" : "5 to 10 cm of snow fell on Monday above approximately 2000 m. The wind was light to moderate adjacent to ridgelines in some regions. The southwesterly wind will transport the new snow. The snowpack is favourably layered and its surface has a strong melt-freeze crust. <br/> <br/> Above the tree line snow depths vary greatly, depending on the infuence of the wind. At intermediate altitudes there are 40 to 80 cm of snow. In all regions less snow than usual is lying."
