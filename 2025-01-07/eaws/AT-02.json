The fresh snowdrift accumulations were deposited atop a weak old snowpack surface above 1800m. on shady slopes. Further snowdrifts will accumulate during the course of the day. The snowpack is highly diverse even over small areas."

Initially the snowfall level will be at 1500m, with wet snow; then in afternoon, colder air masses will arrive and the snowfall level will drop to beneath 1000m. Visibility will be starkly reduced by fog. Winds will shift to northerly as precipitation falls, reach windspeeds of 40 km/hr. Temperatures will drop. At 2000m: -4 degrees in the evening. Further weather forecasts are as yet uncertain, particularly the snowfall level."
