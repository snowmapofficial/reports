Some of the wind slabs from Monday are still prone to triggering.</p><p>The structure of the snowpack varies greatly from region to region:</p><ul><li>Along the Main Alpine Ridge in the Grisons, in the Upper Engadine and in large parts of Ticino, the snowpack is still thin but often completely faceted. In these regions, avalanches can be triggered very easily wherever new and drift snow is deposited on a continuous old snowpack and entrain the entire snowpack.</li><li>In the inneralpine regions of Valais and Grisons, there are distinct weak layers in the snowpack at high altitude. In these, avalanches can be triggered in places and sometimes tear through to the ground.</li><li>North of a line from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Rhine and in the extreme west of Lower Valais, the snowpack structure is more favourable. Avalanches in weak layers in the old snowpack are only possible in isolated cases.</li></ul><p>Below 2400 metres, the snowpack is moistened by rain and warmth in many places.</p>"
