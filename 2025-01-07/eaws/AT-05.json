On shady slopes above 2000m the old snowpack can itself be a weak layer. Above 2200m there are several weak layers of faceted crystals inside the old snow, often prone to triggering. The entire snowpack can glide over steep rocky plates or grass-covered slopes."

In the latter part of the night, snowfall will set in from the south and west. Snowfall level: initially above 1500m, descending to valley level by morning. Initially, rainfall is possible in the southern regions up to 2000m. On Tuesday, snowfall from west and south, quickly spreading to all mountain regions. In the afternoon, drier from the west, possibly with brief bright intervals. All in all, in southern regions over 30cm. Visibility mostly heavily reduced. Winds mostly light to moderate, only at summit level in the Northern Alps will winds be brisk. At 2000m. -7 to -3 degrees; at 3000m: -11 degrees."
