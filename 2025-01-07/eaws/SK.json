New snow falls on a very hard, even icy base, which has been created by the fact that it has cooled down considerably after the warming period. There are several ice crusts in the snow cover. The crusts are not load-bearing, so they break through when moving on foot. Movement off the beaten track is difficult. On average there is between 20 and 50 cm of snow in our mountains. The continuous snow cover is mostly above the forest belt."
