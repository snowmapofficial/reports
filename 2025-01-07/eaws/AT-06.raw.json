Below the layer of fresh snow, there is still a more or less continuous snow cover only at high altitudes and on the shaded side. The old snow cover is partially weakened by angular crystals."

The danger spots are in the north and east sectors. It cannot be completely ruled out that a snow slab can be triggered by a small additional load. In places, avalanches can tear through layers of old snow close to the ground and become medium-sized. As the weather warms up, wet loose snow slides are also possible from steep rocky and rugged terrain."

Up to 10cm of fresh snow was recorded in the Niedere Tauern. The fresh snow covers hard or icy old snow surfaces. Under the hard layer, the accumulating transformation weakens the snowpack foundation. As it warms up, the new snow becomes sticky up to the middle layers. The snowpack can settle. In general, the snow cover is very unevenly distributed, with little snow from the middle layers downwards."
