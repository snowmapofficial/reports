Adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls and on west facing slopes dry slab avalanches are possible, even medium-sized ones. Below approximately 1800 m small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible."

Above approximately 1900 m the avalanche prone locations are more prevalent. The solar radiation will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in particular on sunny slopes at intermediate altitudes. The danger of moist and wet avalanches will decrease during the night."
