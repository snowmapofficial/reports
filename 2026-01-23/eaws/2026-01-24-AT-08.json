        "comment": "It is possible to trigger slab avalanches in the old snow particularly by large additional loading.  If a release sweeps away the entire snowpack the avalanche can grow to medium size. Danger zones are located especially on steep shady slopes, but also in wind-loaded gullies and bowls in all aspects. Whumpf noises and fractures on the surface are alarm signals. Activities in outlying terrain away from secured ski runs require experience in evaluating the terrain and assessment of avalanche dangers. In addition, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations have been generated particularly in ridgline and pass areas.",
