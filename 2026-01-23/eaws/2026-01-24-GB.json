Some overnight and early morning snow showers mainly above 700 metres, dry for the remainder of the day. Winds will be Strong mostly Easterly but occasionally East-South-Easterly.\nObserved Weather Influences: New snow arrived mainly last night and early this morning on very strong variable Southerly winds and deposited a lot of the new snow to lower elevations. Today the freezing level was around 750 metres with scattered snow showers. Winds were mainly South-South-Easterly and strong on the higher summits.\nObservedSnowStability: The recent mild conditions of early yesterday left the snowpack moist at most levels this refroze last night. Strong winds have scoured many exposed areas leaving a hard icy surface. Soft unconsolidated snow exists at lower elevations. Deposits of new poorly bonded windslab is present in wind sheltered areas such as gully tops and coire rims. West through to North to North-Easterly aspects above 900 metres are most affected. Cornices are fragile on same aspects. The avalanche hazard is Moderate."
