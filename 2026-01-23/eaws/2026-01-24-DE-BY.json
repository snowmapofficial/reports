        "comment": "The avalanche risk is moderate above 1800 metres and low below that. The main problem is a persistent weak layer. Dry slab avalanches can still be triggered occasionally by slight additional loads on very steep slopes. Avalanche prone locations are found at the transition from little to much snow, for example at the entrance to gullies and bowls. Slab avalanches can reach medium size on snowy eastern and northern slopes at higher altitudes.",

The base of the snowpack consists mainly of faceted crystals. The snow surfaces are very varied, sometimes crust can be formed by wind or heat, often dominated by thin breakable crust. At the highest elevations, the snow is sometimes soft on shady slopes. At high altitudes, some small-scale wind slab can develop. The snow depths are below average."
