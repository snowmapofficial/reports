Slab avalanches can be triggered in some places even with little additional load and can reach medium size when breaking through the persistent weak layer. The danger areas are located in particular in the north to east aspects behind ridgelines and terrain edges as well as in the entrance areas to steep gullies and bowls. As visibility is poor and the avalanche prone locations are sometimes covered by a thin layer of soft new fallen snow, they are not always easy to recognise."
