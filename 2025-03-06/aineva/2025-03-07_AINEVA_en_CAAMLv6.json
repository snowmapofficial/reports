This applies especially above approximately 2700 m along the border with France and along the border between Valais and Italy. <br/> A clear night: Outgoing longwave radiation during the night will be good. The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften later than the day before. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls."

In shady places that are protected from the wind: Towards its surface, the snowpack is dry and has a loosely bonded surface. <br/> Snow depths vary greatly above approximately 2200 m, depending on the infuence of the wind. Adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas and at high altitude a little snow is lying. At low altitude less snow than usual is lying."
