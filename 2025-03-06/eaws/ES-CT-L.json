        "comment": "As a consequence of southerly wind, sometimes avalanche prone wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls as well as at elevated altitudes. In the course of the day further wind slabs will form. In many cases the avalanches are small and can be released by a single winter sport participant. In particular at the southern border of Aran they can in isolated cases reach medium size. Shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate this situation. <br/> <br/> Moist snow slides are possible, but they will be mostly small. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on very steep sunny slopes and on shady slopes below approximately 2200 m, in particular in the northern half of Aran. <br/> <br/> Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for caution.",
