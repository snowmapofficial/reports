        "SnowDistribution": "Wet patchy diminishing snow throughout.  A day of flat light and no definition.  Winds 20-30 mph with stronger gusts on summits.",
        "Comment": "Becoming cooler by morning. Snow cover is limited to patchy remnants in the higher North and East facing corries and gullies. Check out today\\'s blog photos for more information on the extent of remaining snow.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "Conditions overnight will remain mild with rain at all levels  becoming dry through the day. Winds will lessen overnight becoming moderate generally Southerly. The freezing level by morning will be around 1100 metres rising to 1500 metres through the course of the day.",
        "SnowStability": "The mild and damp conditions overnight will maintain the soft and moist snowpack at most levels, stability will be generally good. Cooler conditions by morning may start to firm up snow on higher exposed slopes. Isolated small fragile cornices may exist mainly above 1000 metres. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Mild and windy conditions with rain at all levels overnight have affected the area, the freezing level was well above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Mild conditions with rain at all levels have reduced the snow cover in all areas. Greatest accumulations of snow exist mainly as patches in the higher Northerly and Easterly corries and gulleys. The remaining snowpack is generally soft and moist at levels. Stability is generally good. Small cornices may exist in localised areas mainly above 1000 metres on North-East and Easterly aspects.  The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "SnowDistribution": "Sparse snow cover mostly bare ground.  Cloudy on the tops.  Winds 30-40 mph.",
        "Comment": "Friday is generally settled with slightly cooler temperatures, the weekend looks mixed, with the best weather most likely on Sunday. Potentially a return to colder conditions in the hills early next week, but precipitation levels may be low with high pressure building through next week giving dry and bright conditions, perhaps cooler nights.",
        "WeatherInfluences": "There will be some light rain through Thursday evening, to all levels, which will clear overnight to give a largely dry day on Friday. Gale force South-Westerly winds on the tops will ease steadily throughout the period, to light winds by Friday afternoon. Freezing level will be at or just above the highest summits.",
        "SnowStability": "Scattered snow patches will remain on North to East aspects above 850 metres, mainly around coire rims on the more inland mountains. These snow patches will remain stable and well bonded. Elsewhere the hills will be largely snow free. The avalanche hazard will be Low.",
        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "After overnight rain to all levels it was a generally dry but cloudy day. The winds were very strong South-South-Westerly and the freezing level remained well above the summits.",
        "ObservedSnowStability": "Isolated patches of snow can be found, on North to East aspects above 850 metres, mainly around coire rims on the more inland mountains. These remnants of snow are stable and continue to thaw and diminish. The avalanche hazard is Low.",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Rain for a few hours overnight will clear leaving a dry day. Gale force winds will ease through the night becoming light  generally from the South-West. The freezing level will lower to hover just above summit height.",
        "SnowStability": "The existing snow patches will be stable and well bonded throughout.  Overnight, there is potential for summit height snow patches to refreeze whilst the slow thaw will continue elsewhere. Greatest amounts will be found on North to East aspects above 1000 metres around coire rims and back walls, ridge flanks and the plateau area.  Very little snow below this height.  The avalanche hazard will be Low.",

        "ObservedWeatherInfluences": "Overnight rain showers cleared by early morning to give a dry day. After a clear and bright morning cloud cover quickly developed with the base around 700 metres. Southerly winds gained in strength during the morning to become very strong during the afternoon.
