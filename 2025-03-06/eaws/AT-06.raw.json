Temperatures are rising quickly during the course of the day and will be around 2 to 4 degrees in 2.000 m at noon."

These avalanches are mostly small to medium sized. Occasionaly fresh snowdrift deposits could be triggered as small slab avalanches."

During the night the snow cover can cool down and solidify."
