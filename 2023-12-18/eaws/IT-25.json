The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in north to northeast to northwest facing aspects and on wind-loaded slopes. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack serve as an alarm indicating the danger. As a consequence of warming individual small and, in isolated cases, medium-sized moist and wet avalanches are possible below approximately 2000 m.",
