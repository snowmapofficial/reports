        "comment": "Avalanche danger is moderate. Main problem: gliding snow. Small-to-medium glide-snow avalanches can release naturally at any time of day, esp. on very steep wooded and grass-covered slopes. Furthermore, the snowpack will become wetter in the early part of the day, making naturally triggered small loose-snow avalanches possible on extremely stesp south-facing slopes.\r\nOld snowdrifts can in isolated cases be triggered in steep ridgeline terrain and in wind-loaded gullies and bowls at high altitudes by large additional loading, small-to-medium releases. Caution urged in transitions from shallow to deeper snow, esp. in NE/S/SW facing terrain. Beware breaking cornices!",

        "comment": "The snowpack base is moist/wet up to high altitudes, at low altitudes it is melt-freeze encrusted as a result of nocturnal outgoing radiation. Combined with warm air, the sun can still moisten the snowpack up to high altitudes. In extremely steep rocky terrain, loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally. Old snowdrifts at high altitudes are sometimes deposited atop soft layers, otherwise no striking weak layers in the snowpack are evident."
