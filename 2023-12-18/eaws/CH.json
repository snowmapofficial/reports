In very isolated cases avalanches can be triggered in the old snowpack and reach medium size. Caution is to be exercised in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow. As a consequence of a moderate westerly wind, small wind slabs will form in the afternoon especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> Meticulous route selection is advisable.",

The snowpack structure is generally favourable. Weak layers in the old snowpack are sometimes present around older rain crusts but are so deep in much of the snowpack that it is unlikely they would be released by people. Avalanches triggered by people in these weak layers were last reported on Saturday on the central part of the Main Alpine Ridge. In southern Upper Valais, Ticino, Moesano, Val Bregaglia and Val Poschiavo, there are average snow depths at altitude. In these regions, older weak layers may be released by people in isolated cases.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially below 2400 m.

As a consequence of a moderate westerly wind, small wind slabs will form in the afternoon especially adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.

The snowpack structure is generally favourable. Weak layers in the old snowpack are sometimes present around older rain crusts but are so deep in much of the snowpack that it is unlikely they would be released by people. Avalanches triggered by people in these weak layers were last reported on Saturday on the central part of the Main Alpine Ridge. In southern Upper Valais, Ticino, Moesano, Val Bregaglia and Val Poschiavo, there are average snow depths at altitude. In these regions, older weak layers may be released by people in isolated cases.</p><p>Gliding avalanches are still to be expected, especially below 2400 m. These may become particularly substantial on the northern flank of the Alps and in Lower Valais.</p>"
