      "comment" : "In the high altitudes of the Western and High Tatras (above 1700 m above sea level) there is still an INCREASED avalanche danger level 3. The last period of snowfall was accompanied by very strong winds. On the places where the snow was deposited (leeward sides of couloirs, saddles and leeward facing moguls), dangerous snow slabs and pillows of different thicknesses were formed. Their distribution is very local - depending on the relief and the prevailing wind direction. Avalanche release on such slopes, especially on steep slopes, is possible with only a small additional load. Occasionally, spontaneous, medium-sized avalanches are possible."

The older snow cover is frozen and very hard, with new, mainly slabby snow of varying thickness on the surface, depending on the wind and the relief. A lot of the new snow has been blown by strong winds into the forest zone, where it is loose and powdery, 15-30 cm thick, but it has fallen directly on terrain without older snow."
