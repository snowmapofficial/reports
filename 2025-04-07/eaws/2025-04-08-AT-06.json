There the triggering of slab avalanches within the old snow can\u00b4t be ruled out. In few places fresh snowdrift deposits which formed with the northerly winds are prone to triggering, the risk of falling outweighs the risk of burial. In sunny rocky terrain loose-snow avalanches due to radiation can\u00b4t be ruled out. In steep slopes risk of falling on the hoar-like surfaces.",

In places thin snowdrift deposits have formed which are poorly bonded with the old snow cover. Weak layers are only found in shady slopes in the highest altitudes within the old snow cover (Graupel, soft crystals). The old snow cover is moist even in high altitudes, especially on sunny slopes. In medium altitudes the snow cover has decreased especially on sunny areas."

A strong northern high stream causes a relatively cold and windy mountain weather. Monday night is partially cloudy. Tuesday morning will be dominated by clouds and some unproductive snow showers in Kalkalpen. In the afternoon it starts to clear up and it will be sunny in the evening. The northern winds remains brisk to strong especially in the eastern regions. Temperatures at 2.000 m are between -8 and -4 degrees, at 1.500 m between -4 and +1 degrees."
