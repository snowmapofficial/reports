      "comment" : "All in all, the snowpack is well consolidated and stable, in early morning it is melt-freeze encrusted, then turns to firn-snow and becomes moistened from above. Only on steep shady slopes at highest altitudes is the snow still powdery. There, isolated layers of faceted crystals have persisted,in the uppermost part of the snowpack.  However, these are hardly likely to release. At intermediate altitudes the snowpack on sunny slopes has receded significantly, the fundament is wet over far-reaching areas. Gliding snow masses are possible."
