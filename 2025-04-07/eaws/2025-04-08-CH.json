In southern Valais, Ticino and Grisons, there are faceted layers deeper in the snowpack. A few avalanches have been triggered in the old snowpack in recent days, especially from the Davos region via the Engadine to Val M\u00fcstair, and occasionally also on the Main Alpine Ridge in Valais.</p><p>The snow is also becoming increasingly moist higher up and on shady slopes. On southern slopes, the snowpack is water-saturated up into the high Alpine regions, while on eastern and western slopes the majority is water-saturated up to around 2600 m. North-facing slopes are water-saturated to around 1800 m, with the surface moist up to around 2400 m. In areas with weak snow layering, moist slab avalanches can be triggered by people in some places.</p><p>A strong melt-freeze crust will form during the night into Tuesday. As daytime temperatures rise in the sunshine, this will soften as the day progresses and the risk of wet and gliding avalanches will increase.</p>"
