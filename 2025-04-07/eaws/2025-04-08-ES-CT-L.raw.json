      "comment" : "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions generally. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of wet and gliding avalanches to level 2 (moderate). This applies in particular in the regions with a lot of snow at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor√ßa and Pallars. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> The old wind slabs can be released in isolated cases on extremely steep, little used shady slopes and at elevated altitudes. In very isolated cases these are medium-sized."

    "snowpackStructure" : {
      "comment" : "The surface of the snowpack will freeze to form a strong crust and will soften during the day. The spring-like weather conditions as the day progresses will give rise to increasing moistening of the snowpack in all aspects. <br/> The old snowpack will be moist over a wide area. This applies on sunny slopes in all altitude zones, as well as on shady slopes at low and intermediate altitudes. <br/> <br/> In particular very steep, little used shady slopes: Individual weak layers exist in the old snowpack also at elevated altitudes. <br/> <br/> Backcountry tours should be started and concluded early."
