        "comment": "A clear night will be followed in the early morning by favourable avalanche conditions generally. As the day progresses as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be a gradual increase in the danger of wet and gliding avalanches to level 2 (moderate). This applies in particular in the regions with a lot of snow at the border to Benasque and at the border to Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars. These can to an increasing extent be released by people or triggered naturally. Gliding avalanches can also occur. <br/> <br/> The old wind slabs can be released in isolated cases on extremely steep, little used shady slopes and at elevated altitudes. In very isolated cases these are medium-sized.",
