These avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on extremely steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m and on very steep west and east facing slopes above approximately 2800 m. Avalanches can in some cases reach medium size. <br/> <br/> As a consequence of warming during the day and the solar radiation, the likelihood of moist avalanches being released will increase a little. <br/> <br/> The mostly small wind slabs of the last few days are in some cases prone to triggering especially on very steep shady slopes in high Alpine regions. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> <br/> Individual gliding avalanches can also occur. This applies on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2600 m."
